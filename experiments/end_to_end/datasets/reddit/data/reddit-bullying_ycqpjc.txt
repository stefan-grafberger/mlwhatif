BODY ART IN HOSUTON, TEXAS in 2017\n\nI'd like to start off my experience by telling a backstory of myself.\n\nI was in my early 20's, I had recently graduated from college a year before. I had worked for a local tv station and\n\ngraphics company, however I had gotten laid off.\n\nAt the time I was unemployed for about a month, before I saw that Texas Body Art was hiring for a receptionist.\n\nI was hesitant at first, even though I had experience in an office environment, I was not sure if the drive was worth it.\n\nI was not sure if I wanted to work a job out of my field. But being an adult means doing what you have to do to make ends meet.\n\nBy then I had applied to numerous jobs, I was tired of sitting at home, and I had studnent loans I had to pay off.\n\nI should have just kept looking, and I should have never went to fill out an application.\n\nIt would have saved me my time, and most of all years of emotional distress.\n\nFirst off I interviewed with the manager at the time the owner was there when I went to drop my resume. He interviewed me as well.\n\nThe first red flag should have been when the owner himself said that the artist will try to intimidate me which right there should have been a red flag.\n\nFirst of what owner would allow his employees to intimidate someone. The manager also said the same thing to me. And how they would try to walk over me if i let them.\n\nAt first I thoguht....okay this has to be a joke, but I was young and it was early on in my employment career, so I thought how bad could it be. The second red\n\nflag should have been when I asked\n\nthe manager about breaks when she said 'we don't get breaks\".....and keep in mind the schedule was 6 hours shifts on some days\n\nand 15 hour shifts twice a week, to allow the 2nd receptionist a day off. So that means we never really got a REAL \"break\"\n\nlet alone a lunch break. If I did take a tiny break I would tell the tattoo artist that were in the shop that I was going to take\n\na break, which meant they had to man the phones and take payments etc ...some tattoo artist were cool about it others not so much. It got to the point sometimes I would\n\njust walk outside to give myself a moment of peace, being there all day was beyond overwhelming\n\nI even remember only having two days of \"training\" I was given a packet that did give me SOME answers to what my duties were as a\n\n\"counter girl\" what some people called me. But alot of the stuff was learn as you go. Anytime I had a question I would ask the tattoo artist\n\nas stated some of them were nice but the majority of them were always rude BUT there were TWO in particular that were just absoulty horrible.\n\nAnd treated me like I was beneath them. Like I was trash. Now to avoid getting sued I wont name them. But one was a male and one was a female.\n\nAnytime I made a slight mistake because I am human, AND not to mention some days I was working 15 hours with barealy a break, so as you can\n\nunderstand I was running on fumes. There were days were I was just exhausted not physically but emotionally and mentally. From dealing with customers BUT also dealing\n\nwith the tattoo artist I worked with , and their never ending attitude and degrading comments they would make towards me.\n\nI was called a moron, an idiot, stupid, a bitch and the last straw for me was when the female artist called me a cunt.\n\nYes a cunt. For months her and the other male tattoo artist who made it a game almost loved to treat me horrible.\n\nAt one point said female artist was upset because she kept asking me personal questions in regards to my personal life which i did not see appropriate\n\nseeing as that i was there to work not make friends\n\nshe then went to threaten me and said that she would tell the owner that i needed to be fired because she couldn't work with someone she knew nothing about\n\nI had enough of it and decided I was not going\n\nto speak to her or answer anything she tells me unless I had to. That whole day she was on me from getting on me over work that SHE forgot to save on the computer\n\nthat THEY used to use photoshop, to \"forgetting\" to do little things left and right she was just looking to get on me about every little thing.\n\nWhat I could not wrap my head around was that all these people I worked with were much older than me. If not in their mid to late 20's. I just could not understand\n\nwhy they acted in such a way. Why they treated me in such an ugly manner. The female artist in particular was in her 30's.\n\nIn my mind it was like what do you benefit by making a 20 something year old feel so horrible, by calling me names by making their day just horrible?\n\nIt got to a point I felt nothing but anxious and uncomfortable going into work.\n\nI dreaded the days I had to work with said female and male artist. Because when they were both there together. It was like they just loved to torment me.\n\nThe day I was called a cunt by said female artist , I almost cried. I did cry on the way home that night. But i tried my best to keep my composure in front of her.\n\nI told myself that was it. Im not dealing with anymore.\n\nThe following day when I went to pick up their checks from the second tattoo shop location I talked to the manager. And told her how I had been treated.\n\nBy this time it was a new manager. Not the same one. This was about 3 months after I had started working there.\n\nWhat angered me was her initial reaction....which was \"Why didn't you tell anyone.\"......I was in complete shock. Almost like she didn't believe me, its like asking\n\nand abuse victim, why didn't you do anything. When I told her I didn't want to make any problems for myself or anyone in general her demeanor changed. BUT also the other\n\nreceptionist I worked with was FRIENDS with said female tattoo artist. So I had a feeling she wouldn't even believe me.\n\nShe then apologized. When she asked who the two artist were I did not say anything to her. But of course I believe she knew who one them might be. Because from what\n\nI had heard from others they had problems with him in the past and the way he treated other receptionist.\n\nNot to mention i KNOW for a fact that they have had issues from the way the artist treated past receptionist as well from the stories i had heard.\n\nWhat really hurt the most is that the OWNER himself never even called or texted to apologize for the way HIS own employees treated me.\n\nThey quickly just made another job posting for another receptionist and acted like nothing happened.\n\nThat there is not how you should run a business. If you know that your employees mistreat someone for no apparent reason other than the sole reason being there just\n\n\"a dumb counter girl\". It needs to be addressed and corrected. You never know what someone is dealing with outside of work . The struggles their going through.\n\nI was far from \"dumb\" I had a degree and had experience working in the broadcasting industry.\n\nFor someone to feel uncomfortable , to be bullied and harassed in the work place is NOT okay in any form.\n\nNow youre probably wondering why now?\n\nWhy after years am I just sharing my story?\n\nAt the time this happened I was young, the work world was still new to me, I was shy, kept to myself , and soft spoken. I did not think anyone would believe me or\n\ntake me seriously.\n\nNow years later, 2022, Im in my late 20's , the years of experience with life has made me gain courage, confidence , and I also want to mention I am a veteran now.\n\nYes, I went as far as to serve our country.\n\nI just want whoever is reading this to know they are not alone. And if you have ever experience this type of treatment share youre story.\n\nThe original tattoo shop location I worked at is no longer there, I believe they either sold it or changed names im not exactly sure.\n\nSaid female artist i believe she was on that tattoo show i cant remember what its called, she now owns her own shop somewhere in cypress.\n\nBut the second Texas Body art off jones rd is still open.

I had worked for a local tv station and&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;graphics company, however I had gotten laid off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the time I was unemployed for about a month, before I saw that Texas Body Art was hiring for a receptionist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was hesitant at first, even though I had experience in an office environment, I was not sure if the drive was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was not sure if I wanted to work a job out of my field. But being an adult means doing what you have to do to make ends meet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By then I had applied to numerous jobs, I was tired of sitting at home, and I had studnent loans I had to pay off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should have just kept looking, and I should have never went to fill out an application.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would have saved me my time, and most of all years of emotional distress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First off I interviewed with the manager at the time the owner was there when I went to drop my resume. He interviewed me as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first red flag should have been when the owner himself said that the artist will try to intimidate me which right there should have been a red flag.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First of what owner would allow his employees to intimidate someone. The manager also said the same thing to me. And how they would try to walk over me if i let them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first I thoguht....okay this has to be a joke, but I was young and it was early on in my employment career, so I thought how bad could it be. The second red&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;flag should have been when I asked&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the manager about breaks when she said &amp;#39;we don&amp;#39;t get breaks&amp;quot;.....and keep in mind the schedule was 6 hours shifts on some days&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and 15 hour shifts twice a week, to allow the 2nd receptionist a day off. So that means we never really got a REAL &amp;quot;break&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;let alone a lunch break. If I did take a tiny break I would tell the tattoo artist that were in the shop that I was going to take&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;a break, which meant they had to man the phones and take payments etc ...some tattoo artist were cool about it others not so much. It got to the point sometimes I would&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;just walk outside to give myself a moment of peace, being there all day was beyond overwhelming&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I even remember only having two days of &amp;quot;training&amp;quot; I was given a packet that did give me SOME answers to what my duties were as a&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;counter girl&amp;quot; what some people called me. But alot of the stuff was learn as you go. Anytime I had a question I would ask the tattoo artist&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;as stated some of them were nice but the majority of them were always rude BUT there were TWO in particular that were just absoulty horrible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And treated me like I was beneath them. Like I was trash. Now to avoid getting sued I wont name them. But one was a male and one was a female.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anytime I made a slight mistake because I am human, AND not to mention some days I was working 15 hours with barealy a break, so as you can&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;understand I was running on fumes. There were days were I was just exhausted not physically but emotionally and mentally. From dealing with customers BUT also dealing&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;with the tattoo artist I worked with , and their never ending attitude and degrading comments they would make towards me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was called a moron, an idiot, stupid, a bitch and the last straw for me was when the female artist called me a cunt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes a cunt. For months her and the other male tattoo artist who made it a game almost loved to treat me horrible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At one point said female artist was upset because she kept asking me personal questions in regards to my personal life which i did not see appropriate&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;seeing as that i was there to work not make friends&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;she then went to threaten me and said that she would tell the owner that i needed to be fired because she couldn&amp;#39;t work with someone she knew nothing about&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had enough of it and decided I was not going&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;to speak to her or answer anything she tells me unless I had to. That whole day she was on me from getting on me over work that SHE forgot to save on the computer&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;that THEY used to use photoshop, to &amp;quot;forgetting&amp;quot; to do little things left and right she was just looking to get on me about every little thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I could not wrap my head around was that all these people I worked with were much older than me. If not in their mid to late 20&amp;#39;s. I just could not understand&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;why they acted in such a way. Why they treated me in such an ugly manner. The female artist in particular was in her 30&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my mind it was like what do you benefit by making a 20 something year old feel so horrible, by calling me names by making their day just horrible?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It got to a point I felt nothing but anxious and uncomfortable going into work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dreaded the days I had to work with said female and male artist. Because when they were both there together. It was like they just loved to torment me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The day I was called a cunt by said female artist , I almost cried. I did cry on the way home that night. But i tried my best to keep my composure in front of her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told myself that was it. Im not dealing with anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The following day when I went to pick up their checks from the second tattoo shop location I talked to the manager. And told her how I had been treated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By this time it was a new manager. Not the same one. This was about 3 months after I had started working there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What angered me was her initial reaction....which was &amp;quot;Why didn&amp;#39;t you tell anyone.&amp;quot;......I was in complete shock. Almost like she didn&amp;#39;t believe me, its like asking&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and abuse victim, why didn&amp;#39;t you do anything. When I told her I didn&amp;#39;t want to make any problems for myself or anyone in general her demeanor changed. BUT also the other&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;receptionist I worked with was FRIENDS with said female tattoo artist. So I had a feeling she wouldn&amp;#39;t even believe me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She then apologized. When she asked who the two artist were I did not say anything to her. But of course I believe she knew who one them might be. Because from what&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had heard from others they had problems with him in the past and the way he treated other receptionist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to mention i KNOW for a fact that they have had issues from the way the artist treated past receptionist as well from the stories i had heard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What really hurt the most is that the OWNER himself never even called or texted to apologize for the way HIS own employees treated me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They quickly just made another job posting for another receptionist and acted like nothing happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That there is not how you should run a business. If you know that your employees mistreat someone for no apparent reason other than the sole reason being there just&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;a dumb counter girl&amp;quot;. It needs to be addressed and corrected. You never know what someone is dealing with outside of work . The struggles their going through.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was far from &amp;quot;dumb&amp;quot; I had a degree and had experience working in the broadcasting industry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For someone to feel uncomfortable , to be bullied and harassed in the work place is NOT okay in any form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now youre probably wondering why now?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why after years am I just sharing my story?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the time this happened I was young, the work world was still new to me, I was shy, kept to myself , and soft spoken. I did not think anyone would believe me or&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;take me seriously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now years later, 2022, Im in my late 20&amp;#39;s , the years of experience with life has made me gain courage, confidence , and I also want to mention I am a veteran now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, I went as far as to serve our country.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just want whoever is reading this to know they are not alone. And if you have ever experience this type of treatment share youre story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The original tattoo shop location I worked at is no longer there, I believe they either sold it or changed names im not exactly sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Said female artist i believe she was on that tattoo show i cant remember what its called, she now owns her own shop somewhere in cypress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the second Texas Body art off jones rd is still open. And whoever is reading this, share this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;T&amp;#39;ll this day I still think about from time to time of my treatment there, after leaving I had issues with anxiety to the point the thought of confrontation makes me extremely uneasy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But whoever is reading this.

They took away so much confidence from me that I will never be able to gain back. They told me every day to die, that I'm worthless and ugly. The world would be better without me. When they found I actually wanted to kill myself those two took it to a whole new level. They would taunt me about it. I remember one time Sara told me something along the lines of \" If you wanted to kill yourself so badly why arent you dead b\\*\\*\\*\\*.\" The school did absolutely nothing and even tried to blame me. They finally took it somewhat seriously when Sara tried to push me down the stairs. All they did was call her mom and had a \"talk\" with her. It's just so stupid that they're really \"popular\". they would just send a ton of her friends (aka vultures) every time I actually try to stand up for myself. I go to a pretty small school. Like About 200-300 of us 8th graders at the most So basically, everyone knows about it and doesn't care. It's like they simp for them. Sara is also targeting my friend M. They threaten her and have pictures of his self-harm scars. As for \"Lucy\", she's just really mean. She spread a rumor that my white friend \"R\" was racist. Now, this is a big thing because this is a mostly Black/Hispanic area of town. So Lucy sent her friends to not only bully her but also harm her. I remember one time in science class we had a substitute. R was just sitting there minding her business and they came up to her. They started calling her names and started to pull and CUT her hair. They also hit her too. The school didn't even blink an eye. My friend M is mixed. She/he looks white. They went here last year and nobody cared. All of a sudden she was put in the same class as me. Started hanging out with me. Lucy caught on and started saying that M is pretending to be mixed just because M claims her white side. And the part I hate is  LUCY IS MIXED TOO. One thing I hate about Lucy is that she somehow has everyone on her side. She's gone viral multiple times on social media and I don't understand why she deserves nice things like fame and recognition. The sad part is that no one online will ever know what she has done to me and countless others. Now in our school, we have a principal for every grade. The 8th-grade principal isn't taking nonsense and when I told her, they threatened to send them to jail. Yet it's still continuing. I need to do something to get ATLEAST those two in jail. I want to see them get karma before I get into high school. Or at least exposing them. Yet you will never know who I'm talking about. If you made it, thank you for actually listening to me.

She asked me if I knew what was being said about my daughter.  Apparently whatever had been going on had been spreading for 2 weeks, but the week it really picked up steam my daughter was out the entire week with Covid and had only returned the day she called me.  My daughter was being accused of a horrible and unthinkable act.  Making a list, the kind you might have found in the book of the person Nicholas Cruz in Parkland if you get my drift.  The children were all talking about it and parents were contacting the school.  I immediately went to talk to my daughter to find out what if any of this was true.  It was one of the hardest conversations of my life.  My daughter was hysterically crying and the one thing I will never forget is my daughter crying \u201cMom, I couldn\u2019t make a list or spell anyone\u2019s names because of my dyslexia.\u201d  and I knew that statement was true.  I believe my daughter.  I called the principal and they said this was very serious and started an investigation.  The investigation started with my daughter giving a statement and all her belongings and notebooks being searched.  She later said this made her feel like a criminal.  They cleared my daughter of any wrong doing and were like you are clear great moving on.  I couldn\u2019t move on, I said this was a clear case of bullying and that I wanted it investigated.  They did investigate and more or less found out who started it and perpetuated it.  So my claims are founded.  Her dad and me felt we needed that as no one will play with my daughter anymore.  She stays in at recess with the guidance counselor.  We needed something to show people that this was started as an act of bullying so maybe they will give our daughter a chance.  The school will not give us the name of the child that did it for privacy reasons.  The child will face ramifications, this investigation and it\u2019s findings will be placed in that child\u2019s records and follow them for the next 8 years marking them as a liar and a bully.  They also could possibly be expelled which is honestly what I want to push for because I don\u2019t know who this child.  How can I keep my child safe if I don\u2019t know.  What\u2019s to stop this kid from doing more or worse?  I also feel like the school is doing more to protect the abuser than the did the victim.  I posted in AITA because my one friend said me trying to ruin the other child\u2019s life won\u2019t change what happened or fix things for my daughter.  We talked about it and I get her stance, but I also will do anything to protect my little girl.  I keep calling the school freaking out because my anxiety is getting the best of me.  The last email was because she failed a test this week and up until this even her lowest grade was a 70 so this isn\u2019t just affecting her social and emotional well being.\n\nThe problem:  This weekend was the first time since Monday I felt like I could breathe.  We had a fun amazing weekend filled with Halloween fun.  I took her out of town to get away from the drama.  She was happy and we laughed and smiled.  As the day passed into night I started getting really upset, when I was packing her school bag I started crying.  I don\u2019t want her there.  I know that the school has her back and believes her but I don\u2019t feel like she is safe there anymore.  I asked if she wanted to change schools and she does not because she said she feels like she is being punished for something she didn\u2019t do.  I made all these plans for tomorrow to keep myself busy because I feel like if I sit here and let the anxiety take over I will have to pick her up early.  Will I ever feel comfortable there again?  How can I trust them with my baby?  How do I protect her from something like this happening again?  What the hell am I going to do?\n\nNote I do not cry in front of my daughter because I don\u2019t want her feeling worse.  I signed her up for a martial arts/kickboxing class to help her feel empowered and give her an outlet for frustration.  The school has offered therapy services which we agreed to.

Tommorow I will yet again have to do this but more recently I have felt more scared to go home as I am a bit shorter than them.

One of the main bullies was a supposed friend who always picked on me behind my back but acted like she was my friend her name was alysha  . She would call me ugly, wierd and all sorts of crap behind my back to other people and Apparently I was getting laughed at by the entire group of people she hung around with she did a ton more of messed up stuff luckily I wasn\u2019t the only victim of her . I am now out of school and I cannot seem to erase the memories from my head , any advice on how to remove them .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sw9l", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "xz5irk", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ItalianProud", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 10, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": null, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/bullying/comments/xz5irk/bullied_my_entire_life/", "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/xz5irk/bullied_my_entire_life/", "subreddit_subscribers": 7766, "created_utc": 1665268273.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "bullying", "selftext": "So this is a grammar school with an 'outstanding' rating from Ofsted.

I'm a random teen from a high-school in France. I'm 16 and I'm in the last year before college. I've always had issues with people. I hate to say it because I don't want any bad karma but I'm pretty smart. I have a very bright and quick mind. Through my life, I've never really made any friends with anyone. Except 2 years ago, in my first year of H-S. I made 2 friends, that was the most wonderful time of my life without any doubts. Turned out, 1 guy was getting informations on me and the girl tried to make a friend of her jealous. So I stopped talking to people since probably everyone is like that.\n\nThat was a long introduction but I really need that. Back to 2021, september, first days. I don't speak to no one. No one wants to speak to me or work with me for the rest of the year. I'm getting bullied but I don't give a shit about it. I'm arabic, so I get a lot of racists things about my religion or ethnicity but I still don't care much. The only few times I complained to my main teacher was when I got threats from a student's parent on my phone and when my chemistry teacher made me cry in front of everyone in the class. Nothing is done and no one cares. I get into troubles because I complained, they called my parents and I get beaten. I don't think that what I went through was depression but I think that it was more like so really really bad mood and no motivation. I stop working but I still got very good grades (8th out of 34 students), I start living on \"autopilot\". I don't know how to explain it but I wasn't really there, I decided what I did, but I wasn't there. That's impossible to explain. I only remember what I learn in class and big events and thats' it.\n\n5 weeks was the beginning of the new year. My last year of H-S before college. I get into a class with a of literal n-germans things. They draw crosses on my stuff and says slurs about me all day. I go to complain. As an exemple, 1 ginger kid gets yelled at a bit and that's it. It oubviously didn't stop and even got worse. I go back to complain 2 weeks later, and then the disaster. The director didn't give a fuck about anything. I get called back 1 week later with my counselor, vice-director and 2 main teachers. Get yelled at like a piece of shit for 45 minutes. They call my parents. I don't speak with my dad because he choked me for like 30 seconds and he never apologized so he didn't say anything, and my mom just yelled at me saying that it was the same thing every year.\n\nEveryday when I wake up I don't wanna go there. My teachers literally tell me that no one loves me, that I have no friends, that I shouldn't come to school. No one gives a shit. All students laugh. I honestly only have God by my side anymore and I don't know how this is going to end. I can't take any much humiliation. My future is going to be ruined by those teachers due to the grades and apreciations I'll get from there. I won't go to a nice college (even if my entire scholar life was a big success). I'm really into science and technology. 1.5 years ago I got into quantum physics and chemestry thanks to some college youtube videos. I'm also passionated with electronics and mechanics. I love to build some things that make me feel like I'm some kind of superhero (I know I ain't shit it's just for my daydreams). I made a grapple gun that works very well and I made rockets with sugar, they flew very high.

He made me love maths (I sucked at math before that year). I became \"the best student he ever had\" (he was pretty old so he probably saw a few thousands of them). But today, I'm considered as a deepshit by my teachers. All of my classmates keep talking about how incredible they are, how they are the excellence of the H-S or my ass. The H-S I am in is very bad, one of the last of my region (equivalent to a state in the USA), the level is low, from both students and teachers.

My parents didn&amp;#39;t want to chance my school because they don&amp;#39;t care.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how I&amp;#39;ve been able to come this far without beating anyone or doing anything worse. Now , I don&amp;#39;t understand what happens in math class, I don&amp;#39;t talk with anyone, teachers make fun of me.

He was a bit too friendly, and i realized now i think i was being groomed. He was too friendly and touchy feeling at first with me saying \"like getting hugs from you, i know they are warm i can feel them from here in this cold, i only need your warm hugs, wtf.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2019My sweet and special girl\u2019\u2019. \u2018\u2019I love you friend\u2019\u2019 , i will wipe your tears away and pinch your cheeks in real life, \u2018\u201cyou are cute\u201d, \u201csuch a sweet girl like you shouldn\u2019t be cursing\u2019\u2019,, ''do you still have bruises? if you were here, id pull you close and massage them!!!\" \u2019you are very special , i treasure you, you are my blessing\u2019\u2019. just cause i told him happy birthday and he thought we had a connection because i guessed his birthday right even tho it was on his profile and thats how i knew lol . he also sent me an old song from like the 70s and dedicated it to me and our friendship some of the lyrics went like \u2018my treasured friend you are the only one i need. I see now he was love bombing me.\n\nMy mom got sick with covid and i was very worried about her and im in school, i let this person know. he offered to hug me and hold my hand i told him, i dont feel comfortable with holding hands. he still sent me a picture of his hand anyway and then 5 days after, i didnt respond because i was sick with covid, he got offended and wrote :\n\n\"I guess this is it. 2 to 3 days within my last short.message checking on you, I have not gotten any response. On top of that, 5 days since I wrote the message with the photo. I'd go straight to the point. Part of me feels more worried that something might have happened to you, but a big part of it also felt I'm ignored. I know and understand you may be busy between taking care of mom and school or finding a job, but it's not thar hard to say/write a thought or a simple response to make a friend feel at ease. Also your silence most likely means you have issues with me sending that picture. I am sorry. To be honest, I have the purest of intentions. I don't need to explain myself over and over. I initially thought you'd be happy, or at least feel comfort reading thar message. How would you feel if you send someone a photo and youbget no response? I know it's not as important as sending the photo of someone's face. But still, it's personal for me. Also like, if people keep misinterpreting my care and concern then fine, so be it. This is honestly the first time after 2 months I felt something wrong about this friemdship. I don't want to be attached to this any longer. It's sounding like my online friendship recently and the others in the past. I should just probably be thankful this did not drag on for long. Less time to be attached, less hurt. I guess I value friendship or any.kind of relationship differently than most people. I male them feel uncomfortable.Thank you Best wishes for you and mom, and take care. \"\n\nI told him i didnt feel comfortable with holding his hand and not sure why he sent the picture of his hand to me and that i was sick with covid, forget about that he didnt care about that, he cared more that i was ignoring him than my mother or me being sick.\n\nHe got very very very nasty with me and thought i insulted him when i told him i was not comfortable with holding his hand and why he sent a picture he sent me statements such as ''No wonder people do not like you, you are weird', ''dont flatter yourself why i would like you, keep dreaming. i had many relationships and you never had one, maybe because guys dont like you psychically, even your friend wanted to change how you looked and was indecisiveness  about your looks lol he brought up my crushes and how they never took a second look at me or even talked to me and how they were just nice to me because it was their jobs'' it seems he took pleasure in trying to humiliate me in the sensitive things I opened up to him about\n\nthat was so low when he brought up the toxic people in my past, i was stupid to trust him and he brought up my dead friend which was a stab in the heart to me.\n\nI told him about my grief about an online friend who died from alcoholism in the past and he was messed up to actually bring it up and write \"\"Please just shut up whenever you say, \"I could relate about grief\". Or anything of that kind. You will never understand that because you have never really been in that situation and perhaps, will never be. Losing a partner that you've been living with for long years, and you compared to an online guy friend? With all due respect to him, it's not the same feeling. Not even close. Also with the way you lashed out at me and treated me after, do you think I'd still believe that you felt sad when he left? That's funny.\"\n\nSo apparently my grief over my friend is nothing compared to his. he thinks his grief is the worst in the world and tried to diminish my grief. his last statement to me was \" 'you are 27 and never had a true friend or a proper relationship ' lol. dont worry this is the last time you will hear from me, i just wont let your personal insults slide good luck finding someone who will accept you\n\nHe also told me how his ex gf was beautiful and that, comparing you to her would be an insult to her, i can show you a picture of her'' oh so he now tries to be nice about her. he has never ever seen a picture of me ever and randomly bring this up to boost up his ego. he triggered me so much. His ex gf hated him by the way and made sure to separate her daughter from him when she died to live with her family. His daughter does not like him either and he threatened to kill himself when she was not giving him much attention. now he acts like she does not exist and calls her ungrateful\n\ni never had anyone say so much abuse in a span of paragraphs im still sick with covid and seeing all these stressed me out, not to mention it triggered me and made me suicidal and confirming my thoughts of all my abusers in the past maybe im really ugly and thats why no one likes me and i will never have a relationship like he said because im too ugly and weird as he put it and he keeps denying that he is talking about me and how the world does not revolve around me and tells me how i never talked about the good people in my life, and basically said im a loser that no one likes with no friends or BF and how i kept venting and venting, even though he reached out to me to talk and he vented so much about his ex gf who died in a very bad way,to me, his daughter, his other friend who broke it off with him because he was creeping her out as well and said disgusting things to her as well, and she is younger than me\n\nhe says im uneducated and wont stoop down to my level yet i never said half of the disgusting things he said to me. All because i said i was not comfortable with holding hands, yet he still send a picture of his hands, got upset after i didnt respond for a few days despite the fact he knew my mom was sick, i had school and i explained i was sick, still proceeded to attack me\n\nHe thinks that people are worse off without him in their lives. He told me that i should have been so lucky to have him in my life and good luck finding someone who will care and listen to every issue you have despite going through his own stuff.\n\n\nI still feel so hurt and shocked over what he told me and it triggered lot of bad feelings within myself. I reported him to the mods on the forum but they just gave him a warning and didnt ban him so he is still on there, so i dont go on there as much anymore but still feeling angry and shaken up over it", "author_fullname": "t2_aqwnmpz", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Met a crazy person who bullied me online because i didnt respond enough to praise his hands.", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bullying", "hidden": false, "pwls": null, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_xvg1uw", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 12, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1664892441.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": null, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.bullying", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;i met one of the most disgusting people on the internet. im a 27 year old woman and this man in his 40s tried to befriend me online.

His daughter does not like him either and he threatened to kill himself when she was not giving him much attention. now he acts like she does not exist and calls her ungrateful&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i never had anyone say so much abuse in a span of paragraphs im still sick with covid and seeing all these stressed me out, not to mention it triggered me and made me suicidal and confirming my thoughts of all my abusers in the past maybe im really ugly and thats why no one likes me and i will never have a relationship like he said because im too ugly and weird as he put it and he keeps denying that he is talking about me and how the world does not revolve around me and tells me how i never talked about the good people in my life, and basically said im a loser that no one likes with no friends or BF and how i kept venting and venting, even though he reached out to me to talk and he vented so much about his ex gf who died in a very bad way,to me, his daughter, his other friend who broke it off with him because he was creeping her out as well and said disgusting things to her as well, and she is younger than me&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;he says im uneducated and wont stoop down to my level yet i never said half of the disgusting things he said to me. All because i said i was not comfortable with holding hands, yet he still send a picture of his hands, got upset after i didnt respond for a few days despite the fact he knew my mom was sick, i had school and i explained i was sick, still proceeded to attack me&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He thinks that people are worse off without him in their lives. He told me that i should have been so lucky to have him in my life and good luck finding someone who will care and listen to every issue you have despite going through his own stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still feel so hurt and shocked over what he told me and it triggered lot of bad feelings within myself. I reported him to the mods on the forum but they just gave him a warning and didnt ban him so he is still on there, so i dont go on there as much anymore but still feeling angry and shaken up over it&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sw9l", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "xvg1uw", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Bluepreztel", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 5, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": null, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/bullying/comments/xvg1uw/met_a_crazy_person_who_bullied_me_online_because/", "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/xvg1uw/met_a_crazy_person_who_bullied_me_online_because/", "subreddit_subscribers": 7766, "created_utc": 1664892441.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "bullying", "selftext": "my best friend has been mentally abusing me for a while now - I wear glasses, and she keeps making comments about how bad my eyesight is, how I'm completely blind, calls me eyeless jack and snatches my glasses from my face so i can bump into a wall and die or get lost in the hall of her house.

When I drop her off at school in the mornings it has to be around 7:45 am so that I can make it to work by 8:00 am. This means she has to sit in the lunchroom with 6th, 7th, and 8th graders until 8:10 at which point they all go to the gym until 8:30 when school starts. My daughter takes her lunch everyday because school lunch is just very low quality. She carries a soft zippered lunchbox. \nAnyway, she said every single morning a girl that\u2019s also a 6th grader and on the school basketball team asks my daughter to sit at their table. My daughter felt honored and accepted by them at first, but then the girl started grabbing her lunchbox every morning, unzipping it, taking out anything she liked, and then handing the lunchbox back to my daughter while laughing and playfully declaring, \u201csorry, these are mine now!\u201d And of course everyone at the table (besides my daughter) would laugh about it. I think my daughter saw it as not that big of a deal the first few times, but it has now continued for a few weeks. The girl doesn\u2019t call names or hit her etc. just steals lunch items. Her Dad and I have told her she needs to stand up for herself and tell the girl no or just not sit with those girls, but nothing seems to work. \n\nThis morning, my daughter chose not to sit at their table so the girl comes over to where my daughter is sitting, grabs her lunchbox and removes two small bags of takis, then hands the lunchbox back to my daughter and returns to her table and proudly declared, \u201cI steal her lunch everyday!\u201d all while laughing at my daughter. This pissed me off so bad that I wanted to turn my car around and storm into that cafeteria and just lose my shit, but of course I don\u2019t want to be arrested or embarrass my kid. \n\nI wanted to contact the school about the issue, but my daughter begged me not to because she\u2019s afraid it will make the situation worse if the girl knows she told on her. Plus, my daughter said a teacher that monitors the kids in the lunchroom has witnessed the girl stealing my daughter\u2019s lunch and just laughs about it like it\u2019s cute or something. I suspect because the girl is a popular basketball player. \n\nSo here is my idea for stopping the situation: I\u2019m planning to use a smaller lunchbox that my daughter can stuff inside of her backpack. That way if the bully can\u2019t see that she has brought a lunch, maybe she will leave her alone. They really only see each other in the morning. Any other ideas? I kind of want to try to solve it quietly before escalating it to school authorities. Basically, conflict avoidance is the goal. \n\nI really don\u2019t understand why this kid is doing this other than as a show of power/dominance and to show off in front of her friends.

But I did something stupid in high school. I am autistic and I didn't understand social boundaries back in the day, and this led to me getting super persistent with a girl and getting in trouble. People began talking about how creepy I was. It hurt, so I willingly changed schools to get away from all the drama.\n\nI hoped college would be a fresh start, but someone from my high school shared my story. There was an ex who I met and dated in College whom I had a great relationship with, but just as we're about to get back together, I find out her parents and friends don't like me because of my past, and for her that's a big deal. She chose them over me. And now she's getting married to another man. \n\nI am so pissed that they did this. This was not my fault. I had someone call me toxic becaus of how I behaved. Yes I had insecurities and got jealous which killed the relationship the first time, but that's not the situation related to high school. I messed up, I accept that. But what I won't accept is people spreading rumors about me being a creeper. That is not me, and I wish I could confront those people and tell them off. But I can't do it because it would probably make things worse, and I have no idea where to begin or what to say. \n\nMy ex had everything. She was a fellow autistic adult, she was beautiful, very kind, and even did ballet (I always wanted to be with a ballet dancer). Now she's marrying another man and fell out of love with me. I wish her well, but I'm still angry that her friends and family made her push me away. \n\nI may have gotten jealous and toxic, but I admit my mistakes, and I am not a horrible person.

But I did something stupid in high school. I am autistic and I didn&amp;#39;t understand social boundaries back in the day, and this led to me getting super persistent with a girl and getting in trouble. People began talking about how creepy I was. It hurt, so I willingly changed schools to get away from all the drama.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hoped college would be a fresh start, but someone from my high school shared my story. There was an ex who I met and dated in College whom I had a great relationship with, but just as we&amp;#39;re about to get back together, I find out her parents and friends don&amp;#39;t like me because of my past, and for her that&amp;#39;s a big deal. She chose them over me. And now she&amp;#39;s getting married to another man. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am so pissed that they did this. This was not my fault. I had someone call me toxic becaus of how I behaved. Yes I had insecurities and got jealous which killed the relationship the first time, but that&amp;#39;s not the situation related to high school. I messed up, I accept that. But what I won&amp;#39;t accept is people spreading rumors about me being a creeper. That is not me, and I wish I could confront those people and tell them off. But I can&amp;#39;t do it because it would probably make things worse, and I have no idea where to begin or what to say. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My ex had everything. She was a fellow autistic adult, she was beautiful, very kind, and even did ballet (I always wanted to be with a ballet dancer). Now she&amp;#39;s marrying another man and fell out of love with me. I wish her well, but I&amp;#39;m still angry that her friends and family made her push me away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I may have gotten jealous and toxic, but I admit my mistakes, and I am not a horrible person.

He was working in a group with this girl discussing about safety, bad things humans do and how to talk to someone about it to solve thos problems. A person who's ethnicity is Slovakian, he stole his planner (a booklet that has calendar, note pages, attendance pages, progress etc) and when my little brother found out, he demanded for him to give it back. My brother was understandably pissed off and was given an after school detention for shouting out. \n\nAs soon as lesson finished, the lunch break started and people from that class called him names, trash talked about my parents, threw sticky notes and other objects at him. He couldn't contain his rage and swore at them, they ganged up on him outside during this altercations and beat him up and he came back with bruises at home. \n\nHe told the teachers about the situation and the teachers down played the situation, said they'll do something about it and would you guess? Nothing done, no actions taken, he comes out the headteachers office to be greeted by those people yet again. He obviously ignored them and found his mates and told them about it, so they all went to head of Year 11 to tell them, they took no action too. \n\nHis lunch finished, he went to ICT, still hurting and no teacher for some fucking reason paying attention to a student who's obviously been in a fight and is hurting. It didn't stop at ICT too, his pencil case was stolen, and chucked around in the class, the ripped it and smashed most of his stationery. \n\nThe head of Year finally came to him after he reported his altercation and those students were given a 2 hour detention after school.

So I\u2019ll try to keep it short but this is a story that has developed over months and came to a head this weekend. For reference I am 21F and he is 22M. We live in Germany. Recently we had a festival called Kerbborsche in our village and it is a festival celebrating young Men and the church. Every year a group of men can become the new kerb boys (around 18 years old) and they dress up and basically drink and have a good time leading the festival. For decades after they same group will get together and dress up again and celebrate. Anyways. My boyfriend used to struggle with drinking- he would get super super drunk and his friends would egg him on. Yes it was his choice but it also was peer pressure for sure. In the past years since we have been together he has gotten so much better and I am so proud of him. However in the past year there have been some times where he took it too far and it was hard. Normally when we have drinks together it id fun and positive and we have a wonderful time. When his male friends are involved it turns into a horrible night most of the time. The first night of Kerb we decided to not go and to have a date instead because we know how these boys can be. He got so much crap for it. The boys texted him over and over blowing up his phone with just \u201eKerb.\u201c and the next day, they all made snarky comments to him about not coming. The thing is, many other guys either missed the first day, were late, or left early, and nobody did the same to them. Then at dinner they forced him to drink his whole wheat beer he had just ordered- well not forced, but if he didnt, they would have made a lot of fun of him in front of people. My bf has a role in kerb where he was voted to be the guy that wears a different hat and suspenders and plays this sound machine. This role is also kind of being the guy that makes the fool out of himself. He got this role because they voted it, and I think it was for a reason. He always tells me he never felt special a few years ago and even now, and sometimes felt like nobody liked him until he was drunk doing stupid stuff for them to laugh at! They have made my sweet boy into a clown and I am TOTALLY enraged. (I also know that kerb stuff is tradition but frankly idrc. Just bc it is tradition doesnt mean we cant question it.) I feel sorry for him because he has trouble standing up for himself. When I stood up for him, his friends said I am toxic and an ass\u2026.\nAnother important point is that my bf has epilepsy. (He is fine and is on meds.) however the only seizures he has had were triggered from hard drinking and staying up late in combination. I cant help but think, what kind of friends disregard your safety like this??? My bf was always shy as a teenager, but as it goes, he is really starting to shine. He changed his studies and is loving what he does. He is (ofc) one of the only guys who has ever had a gf and long term relationship (me.) we do fun things all of the time- we travel together always and we do things that dont involve drinking. In the three years we have been together, his friends have never composed plans that DIDNT involve drinking. I feel like since he is shining now, they feel threatened. They were so used to him being a background character and now that he isn\u2019t one- they feel threatened. I think they use this drinking as a a way to dull him down. I have told him how special and wonderful he is, but also said that when he acts like this, it makes him less special and satisfies them. If some of you could give me your thoughts and advice that would be amazing. I really love him and it hurts me so bad to see him cry and be sad. When he gets drunk with them he can also be such a jerk. He pushes people in his way, he can get violent, he screams and he looks completely different in the face. Sometimes he has treated me bad and ignored me around them when he was really drunk. Normally I would not take this but tbh when we are drinking together he NEVER becomes like this- so I kind of feel like he is acting out in frustration and stuff. They are causing him to develop alcoholic problems. Please let me know if you also think what I am thinking sounds right and what I should do to help him. He is the kindest man in the world and has always dropped everything to help when I needed something. I am an international student here and he helped me in so many ways and even took hella time to teach me his language and move in with me in the beginning when I got lonely (temporarily) he doesnt deserve to be put in this vulnerable position", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "I think my bf is being bullied.
