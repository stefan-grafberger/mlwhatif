I'm Phil, I'm 23...this is my story.\n\nSo, when I learned about this reddit page, I was looking forward to meeting new people, and reading their stories. It took some deep soul searching, but I think the best way to introduce myself is through honesty. A little background about me, I was bullied pretty heavily in high school. I always was a \"nerd\" for video games, comics, etc. and people liked to give me shit for that. When college started, I still had hesitations about myself. I would keep a lot about my ambitions and interests from people, including my girlfriend at the time. I did a bit of twitch here and there but I also have a YouTube channel that has LEGO stop motion videos on it. It has over 2 million views, and did pretty well, but I was TERRIFIED that if anyone at my school found out, it would be like high school all over again. I was deeply, deeply insecure about myself because, well because I grew up most of my life being told by other people that I was \"weird\". \n\nAnyways, that relationship with my ex girlfriend came to end (for many reasons, not just this) and it really made me self reflect on myself a bit. Honestly, I was heartbroken and angry. I didn't really have any friends at college, and enough time had gone on freshman year that they had kinda already made their friend groups. Through my grief and anger, I told myself that I wasn't going to hide who I was anymore. Frankly, I wasn't as scared of any consequences because I felt as if nothing worse could happen to me since I had just broken up with someone I was in love with. I spent years working on myself. I started going to the gym. I read books on self-motivation, self-help, relationship stuff, and just overcoming general anxiety/insecurities. \n\nNow, flashback years later, and I am completely comfortable with who I am. I'm able to tell complete strangers about my twitch and YouTube stuff, without any fear of judgement or rejection. I guess the reason why I'm sharing this story is because I WISH I had a resource or someone back then who could've been there for me. When I was having a bad day cause I got bullied, I wish I could've gone on twitch and connected with someone who could've told me things were going to be okay. Well, I want to be that person. I want my twitch yt whatever content I make, I want it to be something people can relate to. Give them a good laugh, a scary moment where we can all be scared together, or crazy moments where we can all cheer. I want people to come to my channel and know that they can ask me for advice or share their thoughts and feelings about their day/lives, and I will respond to them. I want a chat and a community that MOTIVATES and LIFTS peoples spirits. Community is SO SO SO important to me, and I think the only way that we can succeed is if we help each other. If I stream, and only get 1 viewer, but that one viewer messages me in the chat, says hello, we have a nice convo, and he's able to tell me about how shitty his day was but he's so much better now that we talked, that to me is a successful stream. \n\nSO, long story short, if any of you would like to check out my twitch, a follow is greatly appreciated as I go on this journey!

they do nothing about it and when I call her out for those stuff they take her phone for a week yet it isn't a week because she gets it back the next day I tell them about this but they brush it off saying how they let me have my phone so she should have hers I tell them that they are just enabling her to do it more but when I do they just get really mad and send me off then a couple of months of complete hell later she got a boyfriend now the kid  is the definition of the snobby spoiled kid who gets everything he wants then a week after she has been telling me stuff about how I got no friends and how she is soo popular \"she isn't\" she only has like 5 friends and all of them are future serial killers in the making the first one is a complete Karen who nobody likes the second one is the classic quiet goth school shooter lookalike and the other 3 are interchangeable really and she only has one tolerable friend but everytime they get close they end up not being friends anymore then the

knows that I am legally blind and hate to be called special Ed yet she does it anyway because she's ableist then she started watching me like a hawk at school and telling every little thing I do at

like she's some goddess who deserves everything so I can't land a hand on her I've been trying to convince my parents for months that they should send her to a shrink but they just play dumb and play

Then she said the same sentence my friend said then Bryson told Every friend he had and probably posted on social media and added the part that I was autistic so for the rest of the day he harassed me by calling my name and ask if I was autistic at this point no one was given an explanation my friend probably didn\u2019t want this outcome an explanation won\u2019t stop Bryson\u2019s bullying he has no empathy because he couldn\u2019t feel any towards me I did nothing to him all I want is for him to stop so I can live without anxiety.

I was bullied so badly that the school decided to have someone come and do a \"this is what a bully looks like. don't be a by-stander!\" presentation. they'd never done that before. and everyone's eyes were on me. they knew. we all knew. *he* knew, my bully.\n\n\nhe terrified everyone, I know that. it started in 6th grade. started lightly. with cold comments, hurtful things, and I didn't know what to do. I would laugh awkwardly and avoid that he just told me something like \"you're so fucking ugly, its actually kinda funny.\" \n\n\n7th grade, he destroyed me. he left bruises on my body. special reminders as to why I shouldn't exist. kicking my heels, pushing me into walls, stabbing my back with led pencils, tripping me, kicking me under tables, pulling strands of hair, and eventually, almost breaking my arm.\n\n\nof course there were the words too. the threats. the constant reminders of why I shouldn't be alive, why no one loved me, why I deserved nothing but horrible things, why I deserved death. why my laugh was annoying. why my entire being was annoying. and so forth.\n\n\npeople ask me why I didn't tell my parents. well, its hard to find space to talk when you spent a childhood of your mom being on deaths door and her dealing with severe mental health. and then she tries killing herself in front of you. and you're so convinced that if you bring even an ounce of sadness into the house, she'll break and crumble into pieces.\n\n\nmy personal solution? stop talking at school, and make up stories at home about how good of a day I had, extra laughing.\n\n\nso I stopped talking, unless a teacher asked me something. I spent recess sitting by a tree, writing or dissociating or something in-between. one time I wrote a story about a girl who kills herself. and a kid in class snatched it and read it aloud to a group and said \"sounds like a story about you.\" laughing. and maybe it was.\n\n\nI remember when we got school laptops. and id grab random laptops and write things like \"I want to kill myself. I deserve to\" and then delete the document, hoping that somehow, someone would find it in the trash bin and do something.\n\n\nI remember in the back of my english workbook, there being a list of terms. one said the meaning was \"*to take*\" and I added next to it \"-my life because I dont want it anymore\". and another said \"*to cut*\" and I added next to it \"-my wrists\". and I kept those pages hidden. but I was screaming. that was me, screaming. begging. pleading for help. the only way I knew how.\n\n\none day, he was hurting me again. the teacher left the room. and I went to the back to turn in a paper to the turn-it-in basket. he followed me, taunting me, class laughing, him kicking my heels. I then, for the first time, turned around quick, facing him. I yelled \"stop!\" and I kicked his shin.\n\n\nhis eyes. the look of pure hatred dripping down his face. fear, pure fear fled through me and I knew I fucked up. I immediately started backing up and apologizing. but that was not enough. I held my hands up to shield myself but he quickly grabbed my wrist and twisted it swiftly behind my back, forcing me to turn. I knew if I moved, my arm would snap. he pulled and then in another swift moment, took his elbow and threw it into my back. I fell to the ground hard. and he kicked me. over and over. then he leaned down, over my frozen body, and told me how I didn't deserve to live. that I was vile and disgusting. that if I ever, *ever*, did that again, he would hurt me in ways I couldn't fathom. he made it a promise. between him and I.\n\n\nthe class was silent. dead silent. and we all heard the steps in the hallway near. and he quickly went to his seat and sat down. I slowly started to peel myself off the ground when our teacher walked in. her confused face in an awkward smile. she asked me what I was doing on the floor. and I forced a goofy smile on my face to tell her, \"I fell.\" and that was that. classmates refusing to look at me. refusing to acknowledge their silence in my hell.\n\n\nthat night I went home and laughed too much. I was terrified they'd see through me, that they'd see my bruises and ask what happened, and that I wouldn't be able to explain them away. I remember that night. I remember walking out onto the porch at night just to breathe. to let my face fall and collect myself as I was breaking. but I didn't get a chance. my dad stepped outside and grinned at me. he said \"did something happened at school today you're not telling us?\" he was beaming. yes dad. it had, but you'd never guess. I smiled sheepishly, playing into the act, and shrugged. he said \"a boy asked you out didn't they?\" and I did the high pitched defensive *nooo* back and quickly hurried myself inside. let him believe what he wanted, so long as it wasn't the truth.\n\n\ndespite his threats. one day I found the courage to tell the teacher. I waited for the class to shuffle on out to lunch. it was just her and I. and I did it, I spoke up, I told her I was being bullied. and she looked me directly in the eyes and said \"well, I dont see it happening. so it doesn't happen.\" those exact words. they burned into me. and she proceeded to say things that just mumbled and muted in my ears, bringing *him* in to ask if it were true. the consequences hurt me. \n\n\nthen, next year, he was gone. poof. good-bye. and like that, 8th grade year, everyone was beyond nice to me. they were guilty. they were sorry. in a silent recognition of the horrors that happened, they all chose to smile at me, tell me nice things, and in some secret way, begged for forgiveness. and I wasn't going to bring it up. I went along. I soaked it in. and we all played pretend and that was perfectly fine with me.\n\n\nand I thought it was over. finally. the end of the year neared and a girl I was going to be going to the same highschool with, that I had known since I was 7, pulled me aside and said \"hey uh, when we get to highschool, I'm going to pretend I don't know you okay? because you're going to get bullied again. and I don't want to be apart of that. just wanted to let you know.\"\n\n\nI wish I was kidding. but she said that specifically. next year, in highschool, I shared that piece of information to a girl who I later learned had a big big mouth. let's just say that girl who said that too me wasn't as popular as she might have hoped.

I was bullied so badly that the school decided to have someone come and do a &amp;quot;this is what a bully looks like. don&amp;#39;t be a by-stander!&amp;quot; presentation. they&amp;#39;d never done that before. and everyone&amp;#39;s eyes were on me. they knew. we all knew. &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; knew, my bully.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;he terrified everyone, I know that. it started in 6th grade. started lightly. with cold comments, hurtful things, and I didn&amp;#39;t know what to do. I would laugh awkwardly and avoid that he just told me something like &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re so fucking ugly, its actually kinda funny.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7th grade, he destroyed me. he left bruises on my body. special reminders as to why I shouldn&amp;#39;t exist. kicking my heels, pushing me into walls, stabbing my back with led pencils, tripping me, kicking me under tables, pulling strands of hair, and eventually, almost breaking my arm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;of course there were the words too. the threats. the constant reminders of why I shouldn&amp;#39;t be alive, why no one loved me, why I deserved nothing but horrible things, why I deserved death. why my laugh was annoying. why my entire being was annoying. and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;people ask me why I didn&amp;#39;t tell my parents. well, its hard to find space to talk when you spent a childhood of your mom being on deaths door and her dealing with severe mental health. and then she tries killing herself in front of you. and you&amp;#39;re so convinced that if you bring even an ounce of sadness into the house, she&amp;#39;ll break and crumble into pieces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;my personal solution? stop talking at school, and make up stories at home about how good of a day I had, extra laughing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;so I stopped talking, unless a teacher asked me something. I spent recess sitting by a tree, writing or dissociating or something in-between. one time I wrote a story about a girl who kills herself. and a kid in class snatched it and read it aloud to a group and said &amp;quot;sounds like a story about you.&amp;quot; laughing. and maybe it was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember when we got school laptops. and id grab random laptops and write things like &amp;quot;I want to kill myself. I deserve to&amp;quot; and then delete the document, hoping that somehow, someone would find it in the trash bin and do something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember in the back of my english workbook, there being a list of terms. one said the meaning was &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;to take&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; and I added next to it &amp;quot;-my life because I dont want it anymore&amp;quot;. and another said &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;to cut&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; and I added next to it &amp;quot;-my wrists&amp;quot;. and I kept those pages hidden. but I was screaming. that was me, screaming. begging. pleading for help. the only way I knew how.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;one day, he was hurting me again. the teacher left the room. and I went to the back to turn in a paper to the turn-it-in basket. he followed me, taunting me, class laughing, him kicking my heels. I then, for the first time, turned around quick, facing him. I yelled &amp;quot;stop!&amp;quot; and I kicked his shin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;his eyes. the look of pure hatred dripping down his face. fear, pure fear fled through me and I knew I fucked up. I immediately started backing up and apologizing. but that was not enough. I held my hands up to shield myself but he quickly grabbed my wrist and twisted it swiftly behind my back, forcing me to turn. I knew if I moved, my arm would snap. he pulled and then in another swift moment, took his elbow and threw it into my back. I fell to the ground hard. and he kicked me. over and over. then he leaned down, over my frozen body, and told me how I didn&amp;#39;t deserve to live. that I was vile and disgusting. that if I ever, &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt;, did that again, he would hurt me in ways I couldn&amp;#39;t fathom. he made it a promise. between him and I.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the class was silent. dead silent. and we all heard the steps in the hallway near. and he quickly went to his seat and sat down. I slowly started to peel myself off the ground when our teacher walked in. her confused face in an awkward smile. she asked me what I was doing on the floor. and I forced a goofy smile on my face to tell her, &amp;quot;I fell.&amp;quot; and that was that. classmates refusing to look at me. refusing to acknowledge their silence in my hell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;that night I went home and laughed too much. I was terrified they&amp;#39;d see through me, that they&amp;#39;d see my bruises and ask what happened, and that I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to explain them away. I remember that night. I remember walking out onto the porch at night just to breathe. to let my face fall and collect myself as I was breaking. but I didn&amp;#39;t get a chance. my dad stepped outside and grinned at me. he said &amp;quot;did something happened at school today you&amp;#39;re not telling us?&amp;quot; he was beaming. yes dad. it had, but you&amp;#39;d never guess. I smiled sheepishly, playing into the act, and shrugged. he said &amp;quot;a boy asked you out didn&amp;#39;t they?&amp;quot; and I did the high pitched defensive &lt;em&gt;nooo&lt;/em&gt; back and quickly hurried myself inside. let him believe what he wanted, so long as it wasn&amp;#39;t the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;despite his threats. one day I found the courage to tell the teacher. I waited for the class to shuffle on out to lunch. it was just her and I. and I did it, I spoke up, I told her I was being bullied. and she looked me directly in the eyes and said &amp;quot;well, I dont see it happening. so it doesn&amp;#39;t happen.&amp;quot; those exact words. they burned into me. and she proceeded to say things that just mumbled and muted in my ears, bringing &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt; in to ask if it were true. the consequences hurt me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;then, next year, he was gone. poof. good-bye. and like that, 8th grade year, everyone was beyond nice to me. they were guilty. they were sorry. in a silent recognition of the horrors that happened, they all chose to smile at me, tell me nice things, and in some secret way, begged for forgiveness. and I wasn&amp;#39;t going to bring it up. I went along. I soaked it in. and we all played pretend and that was perfectly fine with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and I thought it was over. finally. the end of the year neared and a girl I was going to be going to the same highschool with, that I had known since I was 7, pulled me aside and said &amp;quot;hey uh, when we get to highschool, I&amp;#39;m going to pretend I don&amp;#39;t know you okay? because you&amp;#39;re going to get bullied again. and I don&amp;#39;t want to be apart of that. just wanted to let you know.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish I was kidding. but she said that specifically. next year, in highschool, I shared that piece of information to a girl who I later learned had a big big mouth. let&amp;#39;s just say that girl who said that too me wasn&amp;#39;t as popular as she might have hoped. I still got bullied, like she said. but. she wasn&amp;#39;t completely free of it herself like she had hoped. oops?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;anyway. I came here to talk about something else but this just... sorta came out. and maybe I needed to re-share my story more than I realized. thank you for reading this. this was therapeutic for me. and im happy I got it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sw9l", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "zgz8va", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "i-deserve-nothing", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 8, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/bullying/comments/zgz8va/i_was_bullied_badly_verbally_and_physically_heres/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/zgz8va/i_was_bullied_badly_verbally_and_physically_heres/", "subreddit_subscribers": 7766, "created_utc": 1670597371.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "bullying", "selftext": "Ive had so many ppl remove me.
