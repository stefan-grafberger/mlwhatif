I'm sure if these users are on reddit they'll probably know who this is and just try to harass me more after I post this. \n\nThere was one instace where a user asked about buying custom DDR controllers, and I linked to TriHex (a famous twitch streamer)'s controller\nNOT REALIZING IT HAD NUDITY ON THE CONTROLLER, I had a bunch of users pissed at me \n\nhttps://twitter.com/trihex/status/568241073861963776 I wasn't paying close enough attention to the detail so I get a bunch of hate mail for a small mistake.\nIf I had noticed the nudity at the time I would have censored it, but people were acting like I intentonally did it to troll...\n\nThere was also one twitch streamer in our community that was physically abusing his dog that pissed me off, and I posted his twitch url in the discord asking people to go report him. \nand now people are going around lying and saying that I was the one abusing the dog when I had just asked people to report it, and I had people pissed saying \"wow why would you even post that\" just causing more people to hate me trying to report animal abuse. \n\nI got banned from the group because the owner said he got so many complaints of people saying that I was being annoying for asking too many questions at once just trying to make small talk, \nand I mean this discord is not very big at all but still fairly active with 10+ people talking at once with about 1200 members. \n\n\nI also did get into a fight with the owner according to him, although I don't think I intentionally ment the message to come off as agressive because at the time we were just talking about players within the community. \n\nThe main reason he banned me was because he said \"too many people said you were annoying them, I have no beef with you but you're not welcome here anymore\"  \u200b\n\nThere is a small group I use to be in back in 2015. I thought I was friends with these people so I posted a few selfies since we were all sharing pictures of each other. \nI later come to find out as of 2021 that I've left that group but one of the members was talking behind my back for years despite not being in the group anymore and they saved my selfies,\nand they're posting nasty edits of them mocking me and saying things like \"if I had more pictures of him I'd do much worse shit\"...\n\nThere was one other streamer I was friends with that begged me to stay in the community becausae they're community is so small they wanted people in it because this community is known for causing problems, \nwhich is why their numbers have been dying off in recent years. But I told them I didn't want to be within the community anymore because it was just too much for my mental health. Its been years, and I still \nhave panic attacks that they might try to do something to harm me or my family. They have doxxed me a couple of times and I reported it to the admin of the server, and I had to make a new account to bypass the ban to message him \nand I said \"Hey please answer back ASAP, I have a user doxing me\" and he replies with \"man you had me thinking it was an emergency, I was picking up my kids from school. You're not welcome here anymore\" and just bans me again instead of addressing the issue. \n\n\nWhat should I do? I feel like reporting the account doing this just gets them temporarily banned.\n Seems kind of shitty and petty they're doing this still despite me leaving that community almost 5 years ago. and I've reported once to discord about them doxxing me before, but I don't think my report did anything.\nThey posted my home address in the chat but didn't do anything yet. That message was 3 years ago but you can still find it easily just typing in my username. They even posted my real full name in the chat as well. \n\nI get ptsd from this because it actually makes me sick to my stomach that these people are doing this to me and just wont leave me alone for just trying to make friends and have a good time meeting people with a game I'm super passionate about. \n\nAny advice? I feel like contacting the owner of that server won't really matter since the server is so small they're friends with the owner so the owner isn't really going to do anything. Even trying to contact other servers they're in won't do anything since the discords are so small everyone knows eachother IRL.  \n\nWhat do I do? Sucks they're still talking shit behind my back 5 years later even though I'm not in the community anymore\n\nThere were a couple of users that have even doxxed me and posted where I lived in the discord server which I reported once to discord and they didn't do jack shit. They only seem to mention my name every 6 months or so but still talk about me even though I haven't been in the community for almost 5 years. Why they do it I have no idea, I had no beef with anybody. \nSo it just seems weird they just talk shit behind my back so many years later. There was one server I was kicked from because the owner disliked me and I contacted him that it was an emergency I needed to speak to him asap because one of his users doxxed me and he just replies \"man I was picking up my kids from school and you had me thinking it was a serious issue\" and just bans me from the server. \n \u200bIs it possible I can threaten the owner of the discord server with a lawsuit? \nBecause these guys are practically ruining my life, they're constantly harassing me and talking behind my back and I'm just sick of the bullying and harassment and the ptsd episodes from the stress from this.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Being targeted by a small discord group of gamers", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bullying", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_s0kthv", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 10, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1641823656.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "domain": "self.bullying", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I joined a gaming group back in about 2015 when Discord first launched because I wanted to make friends, I&amp;#39;m a disabled adult and I have a hard time communicating with people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I joined the server I was really passionate about a game I just recently got into and I was trying to make smalltalk with users.

It started to get really bad around 5th grade and it continued all the way through high school.\n\nIt was bad. I was constantly teased, mistreated, and humiliated. I've been called names, slurs, intentionally disrespected, I've been mocked, excluded, I've had objects thrown at me, etc. It was also physical. \n\nI had a boy in 5th grade kick me in the back during lunch time. In 6th grade I had another boy push me down the hallway. In 7th grade a girl sitting behind me put lotion in her hand and smacked me on the side of the face. There have been other instances of physical bullying but these incidents stand out to me the most.\n\nNot only was I being bullied in school, but I was also dealing with it at home.\n\nI have an older cousin who used to pick on me growing up.\n\nThis started when he was around 14. I was 11 at the time.\n\nEvery time he would come over he would pick on me. It was both verbal and physical.\n\nOftentimes this would go on under my older siblings watch who were both 18 and 20 at the time.\n\nThey NEVER intervened, they never stood up for me, and they never told him to stop.\n\nThey would allow him to get away with this. To make matters worse, my sister would get mad at me and put the blame on me and tell me, \"YOU NEED TO STOP ACTING LIKE A LITTLE BITCH!\"\n\nI felt powerless. I couldn't really defend myself. I was too intimidated. He was 3 years older than me and he was bigger than me. This made it more difficult. There were times where I tried to fight back but he would overpower me. \n\nI hate to admit that I never told anyone about the bullying I was enduring. I never reported it. I never told my parents and I never told any teachers.\n\nI was too ashamed and embarrassed to admit that I was being bullied. And I felt like if I would've admitted it that it could've made matters worse.\n\nIf I would've told them I thought that they would look down on me and think I was weak.\n\nIf I would've told them all what was going on I thought they would be very disappointed and even scold me for not fighting back or standing up for myself. \n\nMy sister did this exact thing when my cousin was bullying me.\n\nThis is why I kept it to myself.\n\nI just ignored the bullying, I endured it, I just put up with it.

It started to get really bad around 5th grade and it continued all the way through high school.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was bad. I was constantly teased, mistreated, and humiliated. I&amp;#39;ve been called names, slurs, intentionally disrespected, I&amp;#39;ve been mocked, excluded, I&amp;#39;ve had objects thrown at me, etc. It was also physical. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a boy in 5th grade kick me in the back during lunch time. In 6th grade I had another boy push me down the hallway. In 7th grade a girl sitting behind me put lotion in her hand and smacked me on the side of the face. There have been other instances of physical bullying but these incidents stand out to me the most.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only was I being bullied in school, but I was also dealing with it at home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have an older cousin who used to pick on me growing up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This started when he was around 14. I was 11 at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every time he would come over he would pick on me. It was both verbal and physical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes this would go on under my older siblings watch who were both 18 and 20 at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They NEVER intervened, they never stood up for me, and they never told him to stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They would allow him to get away with this. To make matters worse, my sister would get mad at me and put the blame on me and tell me, &amp;quot;YOU NEED TO STOP ACTING LIKE A LITTLE BITCH!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt powerless. I couldn&amp;#39;t really defend myself. I was too intimidated. He was 3 years older than me and he was bigger than me. This made it more difficult. There were times where I tried to fight back but he would overpower me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hate to admit that I never told anyone about the bullying I was enduring. I never reported it. I never told my parents and I never told any teachers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was too ashamed and embarrassed to admit that I was being bullied. And I felt like if I would&amp;#39;ve admitted it that it could&amp;#39;ve made matters worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I would&amp;#39;ve told them I thought that they would look down on me and think I was weak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I would&amp;#39;ve told them all what was going on I thought they would be very disappointed and even scold me for not fighting back or standing up for myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My sister did this exact thing when my cousin was bullying me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is why I kept it to myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just ignored the bullying, I endured it, I just put up with it.

He kept telling her I was calling her a monkey and I was saying she\u2019s ugly and I said none of those things and I would tell her \u201cno I never said that\u201d but he would keep lying to her! Even though she was literally a couple feet away from me and she would\u2019ve been able to hear me say that.

Now some background:\n\nBeen bullied for as far as I can remember. \n\nFirst memories I have are from pre school, twin and I would both go to this french speaking nursery (we may have been 3 or 4 at that time). I got hit very often by this one other kid named Luca and ignored by the other kids , I cant really tell for aure but the fact that both my brother and I struggled to speak (mixing both languages, spanish and french, to the point were we couldnt make ourselves understood). \n\nOn top of this, we also faced prejudice and abuse from the staff at the pre school: Being made to eat alone in a closet, apart from the other kids, being tied to a matress during nap time, being made to wear a piece of wrap around our mouths to keep ua ftom speaking, having the social services being sent to our home to try and ascertain whether our parents were fit to keep us, etc\n\nHave no clue about how much of that is due to being noticeably foreign (darker skin, hair, eyes and the language thing), but being older I can imagine that it may have had something to do with the whole thing.\n\nWhen we were 6 we were sent into the \"European School system\" where we would learn most subjects in our native language and be surrounded by kids from our nationality. Bullying went on from day one.\n\nThere was this one kid with some degree of \"mental retardation\" in my class (it has never been clear what condition he had exactly, up to today). I played with him on the first day of school and after that this was the only kid I ever had a \"right\" to play with, being ostracised by all other kids. Began getting hit by them too, just like in pre school. At first it was just two of them but then as time went on it got to the point where it would be all male kids in my class plus most of the guys one year above us...\n\nIt was pretty violent too, Im talking about being pinned to the ground, one kid sitting on my chest, one on each arm and leg and having my head repeatedly being bashed against the brick floor. I can\"t even count the amount of times these kids broke my glasses but it got to the point where my dad began slapping me each time I got back home because \"god damn it, they are expensive!\" (Mind you my father made in Belgium about 20 times what my aunt makes in Spain, even today).\n\nHe would also keep telling me that if eveyone hit me it must be my fault, so many people cqnt be wrong he would say. That is something that has stuck with me until today.\n\nThe parents kf the other kuds eventually got on the wagon as well, making up rappiorta and asking the principal to get me kicked from the school. They would also insist on not acceoting my parenta invitations, celebrated moat of my birthdays alone (most of them would not even make up a excuae and simply nit answer).\n\nThis went on until I hit puberty, which was earlier than all other guys in my class (I was 12). At this point the physical abuse began to stop until it eventually stopped somewhere around when I was 13 (by that point I was way bigger and a good 15 kg heavier than all of them). I began to get the attention of oldee girls too, which made me somehow more popular (begqn to be tolerated around the other guys). Still they would regularly make fun of me or keep me out of most of their plans, sort of hanging out in the periphery of the group.  \n\nAt this point I left my only friend aside, 2hich Ive always regreted.\n\nI became agressive and created a tough, fake bad boy persona which somehow had the effect of getting me evwn more attention from girls.\n\nAt around 16 I got together with this girl and began using her as a refuge. Her company was the only place in which I could find some form of kindness and love, but I kept acting as a dick (terrified that she qould atoo liking me if I ever dropped my fake persona). I spent nearly all week ends with her avoiding my new \"friends\" who had begun experimenting with hard drugs (domething that terrified me at the time. That was also a good way to escape my dad and the situation at home (there had been a prwtty rough divorce when I was 14/15 which had made the situation home even worse than it was before).\n\nAt 18 I left Belgium for Uni in Spain, cheated on this girl and got together with a new one. I stayed with her for 6 years. I repeated all of my old habits but eventually dropped my act at about 3 years into the relationship. Once again I spent nearly 100% of my time with her, avoising aocialising with other guys and I was EXHASUTED of pretending. My worst fears were confirmed and as soon as she saw me foe who I was ahe began to tell me I was dull, uninteresting, unsexy and eventually cheated on me.\n\nFast forward to the start of Covid, I came back to my parents in Belgium and met my old frienda again, broke up qith this last person and attempted to maje a meaningful change in my ways. Reached out and began to socialise, truly, for the very first time.\n\nManaged to make some good friends that I have kept until now (still at the \"periphery\" of the group). I also managed to get fully integratrd at some point, but only as a result of finally begining to experiment with drugs and dark parties as well.\n\nA while ago I met this amazing girl and managed to keep a balance between hanging out with people and spending time with her. Limiting time together also allowed me to be myself around her, not having to fake anything, while also not having to show all of myself too much. Lately I have been growing more and more tired of these drugs, unhealthy environment and hence spending more and more time with my current SO. With that the crippling fear of she seeing me for who I am and making her go away is increasing.\n\nSo I guess that TL; DR:\n\nPast bullying has made me convinced that Im deeply unlovable and that there is some invisible thing in me that creates reject. I am aware that there may be some degree of truth to it, but that it isnt my fault and that it isnt as bad as I feel it is.\n\nI would like to be able to pinpoint the things about me that make people uncomfortable/irritated all the while making peace with my past and forgiving my kid self. \n\nHelp?", "author_fullname": "t2_1ihphdk7", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Recurring theme but, how can I both improve AND forgive my kid self?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bullying", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_rrhmyb", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 8, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1640810441.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1640809231.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.bullying", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR at the end!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grew up in Brussels, Belgium. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a 25 spanish (from Spain) male, young worker and currwntly in an amazing relationship.

Still they would regularly make fun of me or keep me out of most of their plans, sort of hanging out in the periphery of the group.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point I left my only friend aside, 2hich Ive always regreted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I became agressive and created a tough, fake bad boy persona which somehow had the effect of getting me evwn more attention from girls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At around 16 I got together with this girl and began using her as a refuge. Her company was the only place in which I could find some form of kindness and love, but I kept acting as a dick (terrified that she qould atoo liking me if I ever dropped my fake persona). I spent nearly all week ends with her avoiding my new &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; who had begun experimenting with hard drugs (domething that terrified me at the time. That was also a good way to escape my dad and the situation at home (there had been a prwtty rough divorce when I was 14/15 which had made the situation home even worse than it was before).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At 18 I left Belgium for Uni in Spain, cheated on this girl and got together with a new one. I stayed with her for 6 years. I repeated all of my old habits but eventually dropped my act at about 3 years into the relationship. Once again I spent nearly 100% of my time with her, avoising aocialising with other guys and I was EXHASUTED of pretending. My worst fears were confirmed and as soon as she saw me foe who I was ahe began to tell me I was dull, uninteresting, unsexy and eventually cheated on me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to the start of Covid, I came back to my parents in Belgium and met my old frienda again, broke up qith this last person and attempted to maje a meaningful change in my ways. Reached out and began to socialise, truly, for the very first time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Managed to make some good friends that I have kept until now (still at the &amp;quot;periphery&amp;quot; of the group). I also managed to get fully integratrd at some point, but only as a result of finally begining to experiment with drugs and dark parties as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A while ago I met this amazing girl and managed to keep a balance between hanging out with people and spending time with her. Limiting time together also allowed me to be myself around her, not having to fake anything, while also not having to show all of myself too much. Lately I have been growing more and more tired of these drugs, unhealthy environment and hence spending more and more time with my current SO. With that the crippling fear of she seeing me for who I am and making her go away is increasing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I guess that TL; DR:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Past bullying has made me convinced that Im deeply unlovable and that there is some invisible thing in me that creates reject. I am aware that there may be some degree of truth to it, but that it isnt my fault and that it isnt as bad as I feel it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would like to be able to pinpoint the things about me that make people uncomfortable/irritated all the while making peace with my past and forgiving my kid self. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Help?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sw9l", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "rrhmyb", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Al-hazred7", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 6, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/bullying/comments/rrhmyb/recurring_theme_but_how_can_i_both_improve_and/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/rrhmyb/recurring_theme_but_how_can_i_both_improve_and/", "subreddit_subscribers": 7766, "created_utc": 1640809231.0, "num_crossposts": 1, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "bullying", "selftext": "I want to move on with my life, but I can't stop thinking of the people that have wronged me and the lasting pain that they caused.
