Being grounded has become such a common phrase that everyone assumes they understand what it means. However, depending on one's lifestyle, views, and environment, being grounded can mean various things to different people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I mean by being grounded is being fully in the present moment. Physically, emotionally, and energetically, firmly in the now. It means that your thoughts are not straying or consuming all of your energy. You are not looking into the past with sadness or the future with anxiety. Take three deep breaths, now you're grounded. Living means being fully present. Being in the present is as simple as breathing, yet being conscious of it takes strength.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTake your time; the small things matter. Every step you take and every smile you give counts. The foundation of the world rests on these seemingly little things. How much more impact can the big things have on you if you can be fully present in the tiny moments of your life? When you are present in every moment, rather than attempting to plan everything, you are enjoying life to the fullest. Every day, you must reconnect with yourself. Once you determine you are worth the effort, your life becomes more meaningful and you flourish.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;What does it mean to be grounded? It means no unkind being is taking up space rent-free in your body. It also means you love deeply, without the need for revenge. It means digging beneath the machine's mind to understand and see the beauty in each human being. \\~ Deborah Bravandt\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Being Unaware\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery living thing in the world benefits from being grounded. Without a solid foundation, your imagination roams and causes havoc. You bump into things, forget things, and make errors. Everyone pays a price for their \"ungroundedness\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing grounded, you expose yourself to the universal energy flowing around you. And when you choose to be fully present, you strengthen your resolve. Tension levels decrease, calm and tranquility arise, and healing occurs. Everyone has been in tense situations where someone is about to lose it, then a calm individual walks in, and everything changes. Every instant of every day, you have the ability to be that calm person who changes the situation for the better. When you remain grounded, you don\u2019t cause havoc in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou experience a separation between your body and spirit when you are not grounded. Your emotional stability and clarity of vision are both affected by this separation, which distorts how you perceive the world. Unfortunately, a lot of individuals lack a sense of grounding because they adopt the beliefs and realities of other people as their own. Your connection to Spirit is out of harmony. During this period, you could feel incredibly unsteady or just off. As a result, it left you feeling depressed and unable to fully live in your fundamental truths. In fact, right now, you might not even be aware of what your truths are.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;In order to deal with the chaos that exists in the world today, you need some grounding. That grounding best comes from knowing who you are. \\~ Michael Ray\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What Being Grounded Looks Like\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou have a sense of tranquility that is rooted in your soulful self when you\u2019re grounded. You feel your inner and outer worlds are equal. Your connection to the spiritual world and your physical body should always be in harmony. You can't stay grounded when your being is out of balance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGrounding involves a closer connection to your inner self and having control over your mental and emotional well-being. Studies have shown that grounding leads to several health advantages, including a decrease in pain, better sleep, and an increase in serenity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow grounded you are is influenced by how you let the environment support or mold you. After all, you can\u2019t change everything around you; you only have authority over yourself. Even after mastering the technique of grounding, there will still be stressful moments. But you will have a strategy for channeling your energy to respond in a targeted, deliberate, and therapeutic manner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo recognize and feel the advantages of grounding, one must engage in spiritual practice and develop more self-awareness. You may mold it through a variety of methods and activities, including mindful breathing, body scans, daily meditation, and gratitude. By practicing grounding, you prepare to receive messages from your soul.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSetting your mental state to \"grounding\" enables you to shift from a prior experience, release collected energy, and prepare for the message. If you are on a path to understanding your soulful self, you need to rely on your inner communications, which come through grounding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;It turns out that people who are grounded and secure don't change much under stress. That's what being grounded means. \\~ Michael Gruber\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why It\u2019s Easy to Be Unaware\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy is it difficult for you to get grounded? Grounding goes against how you were raised. They taught you to persist in your efforts rather than give up. Weren\u2019t you trained to maximize every minute and avoid setting aside time for indulging in self-care? They taught you to plan and be content when the work is complete rather than to be in the now and savor the moment. And they trained you to deal with the symptoms but ignore the cause.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing grounded is crucial for your mental health because it allows you to deflect your energy, yet society doesn\u2019t place much importance on a mind and body that appears to be inactive. Actually, being productive while grounded allows one to feel renewed, but continuing to live life without grounding leads to burnout. Being grounded does not appear to be beneficial for anything other than the mind and emotions, which is why many don\u2019t want to acknowledge their significance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother thing that is underappreciated is how grounding helps you access your intuition and engage with your soulful self.  You can appreciate the importance of grounding because you are aware of the benefits that come from doing so, including the ability to access your soul's skills and senses. And being able to access these powers brings up a level of self-awareness that society will never fully grasp but that you know to be real.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;It is only by grounding our awareness in the living sensation of our bodies that the 'I Am,' our real presence, can awaken. \\~ G. I. Gurdjieff\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why Grounding Is Vital\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGrounding creates the conditions for using your soul powers and soul senses. Setting your focus on noticing the data that comes via your psychic senses is becoming grounded. When you become grounded, you can analyze both internal and external forces. This is how you get experience in receiving messages from your soulful self.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEstablishing the setting, the tone, and your awareness via grounding allows you to accept what is and open up. You must let go of the egoic mind when you ground. You are giving the soul permission to be receptive and perceptive. To do this, you must block out outside stimuli and limit your awareness to the area inside and around you.\n\nGrounding might happen instantly or take some time, depending on your familiarity with a calm state of mind and even your attitude or energy when trying to achieve it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt can be as simple as taking a breath, closing your eyes, and focusing above and beyond yourself to enter this state of shutting off the mind's chatter. People will frequently recommend meditation as a means for you to enhance your awareness and connect with your soul. The goal of meditation is to bring you to a state of groundedness. It calms the mind and helps you concentrate on the present moment.\n\nThis state of mind primes you to receive messages; it serves as your blank canvas.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;As with everything in nature, if your life isn't supported by a grounded source of energy, it will wither and lose its vitality. \\~ Sonia Choquette\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Ways To Ground Yourself\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt takes time to learn how being grounded feels for you. I would argue that being in a state of grounding could seem dull yet pleasant, to offer you a few hints of what it might feel like to be in a state of nothingness. You realize things you may not have previously noticed, such as noises, thoughts, or sensations (emotional or physical).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're sitting in it, you could question your presence. Or feel that it should be more complicated or that was too easy. Since humans overthink things, let me say that yes, it really is that simple.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can also have a loss of awareness concerning the passing of time. Time behaves differently when one is grounded, making it a serene environment to get lost in. Here are three simple ways in which you can use to ground yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Breathing Exercises**\n\nIf you've ever heard the advice to \"take a deep breath,\" you know its effectiveness. When you\u2019re stressed, blood pressure begins to increase and other physical symptoms, like sweating, eye twitching, shaking, and other obvious responses, depending on the situation. As you gain emotional control, mindful breathing helps you return your attention to the present. Find a quiet place to practice this simple grounding exercise. Breathe in to the count of five.  Hold your breath for a count of five. And breathe out to a count of five.  Do this three times. Repetition of this technique can help you refocus and remove your emotions from the current scenario. You redirect your thoughts and behaviors in a way that is more beneficial and healthy for you, centering your body and mind on the present.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.\t**Body Scan**\n\nMentally scan your entire body to get a sense of how you feel from head to toe. Are there any spots that hurt or are uncomfortable? When you aren't in touch with your senses, it can frequently lead to unusual and/or unfavorable reactions. At these moments, it appears nothing is occurring to you, for you, or around you. You can perform a body scan during a yoga or meditation session or as a fast self-check when you're in a challenging circumstance and your emotions are running high. If anything feels out of balance, pay attention to your intuition about how it may be corrected.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3.\t**Gratitude Meditation**\n\nDaily meditation and gratitude-focused thinking are powerful tools for maintaining your sense of grounding. It requires at least a short period of focused awareness. List your blessings in writing or say them out loud. Some individuals find it beneficial to set an intention when practicing meditation because it gives them something to focus on. It sets the tone for the day when you begin it with clarity of thought and peace of mind. Try to return as often as you can to the present moment as your day goes on. Close your eyes and pay attention to the sounds, scents, and visuals you are taking in when you feel your energy shifting. Detailing circumstances might help you understand why you desire to behave a specific way and reduce stress reactions. It enables you to grow internally by helping you connect more with your true, soulful self.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;We can go through our five senses in about a minute\u2019s time to become grounded in the present, and we can do this anytime we find ourselves in worry or speculation. Becoming grounded in our present makes us available to happiness. \\~ Jeff Kober\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Moving Forward While Being Grounded\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery instant offers you the chance to exercise your choice of being actively involved in being fully present or oblivious to it. The practice of grounding involves returning to your core. It does not imply a constant calm or absence of negative feelings. When difficulties throw you off track, it gives you a method to remain calm while regaining equilibrium, and it helps you build stronger bonds with both yourself and other people. By using grounding practices, you act more intentionally and prevent negativity from dragging you down. You feel you have more control and are in balance by practicing techniques like mindful breathing, body scanning, and daily gratitude reflections.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou are inclined to make decisions that are consistent with your soulful self when you choose to be fully present in the moment. Getting in tune with love, connection, compassion, and empathy leads to decisions that feel aligned with your soul. You develop the capacity to appreciate your genuine rhythm and feel a natural, relaxing flow in both your internal and exterior worlds.\n\n&gt;When rooted and grounded in The Divine, you can rise above every misery. \\~ Tirzah Libert", "author_fullname": "t2_kfticokc", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Being Grounded Is A Powerful And Positive Way to Live A Graceful Life", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/selfimprovement", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_yiuezr", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tips and Tricks", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 8, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1667264448.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.selfimprovement", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I say you need to start each day being grounded, what do I mean?

That grounding best comes from knowing who you are. ~ Michael Ray&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What Being Grounded Looks Like&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have a sense of tranquility that is rooted in your soulful self when you\u2019re grounded. You feel your inner and outer worlds are equal. Your connection to the spiritual world and your physical body should always be in harmony. You can&amp;#39;t stay grounded when your being is out of balance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grounding involves a closer connection to your inner self and having control over your mental and emotional well-being. Studies have shown that grounding leads to several health advantages, including a decrease in pain, better sleep, and an increase in serenity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How grounded you are is influenced by how you let the environment support or mold you. After all, you can\u2019t change everything around you; you only have authority over yourself. Even after mastering the technique of grounding, there will still be stressful moments. But you will have a strategy for channeling your energy to respond in a targeted, deliberate, and therapeutic manner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To recognize and feel the advantages of grounding, one must engage in spiritual practice and develop more self-awareness. You may mold it through a variety of methods and activities, including mindful breathing, body scans, daily meditation, and gratitude. By practicing grounding, you prepare to receive messages from your soul.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Setting your mental state to &amp;quot;grounding&amp;quot; enables you to shift from a prior experience, release collected energy, and prepare for the message. If you are on a path to understanding your soulful self, you need to rely on your inner communications, which come through grounding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It turns out that people who are grounded and secure don&amp;#39;t change much under stress. That&amp;#39;s what being grounded means. ~ Michael Gruber&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Why It\u2019s Easy to Be Unaware&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why is it difficult for you to get grounded? Grounding goes against how you were raised. They taught you to persist in your efforts rather than give up. Weren\u2019t you trained to maximize every minute and avoid setting aside time for indulging in self-care? They taught you to plan and be content when the work is complete rather than to be in the now and savor the moment. And they trained you to deal with the symptoms but ignore the cause.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being grounded is crucial for your mental health because it allows you to deflect your energy, yet society doesn\u2019t place much importance on a mind and body that appears to be inactive. Actually, being productive while grounded allows one to feel renewed, but continuing to live life without grounding leads to burnout. Being grounded does not appear to be beneficial for anything other than the mind and emotions, which is why many don\u2019t want to acknowledge their significance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing that is underappreciated is how grounding helps you access your intuition and engage with your soulful self.  You can appreciate the importance of grounding because you are aware of the benefits that come from doing so, including the ability to access your soul&amp;#39;s skills and senses. And being able to access these powers brings up a level of self-awareness that society will never fully grasp but that you know to be real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is only by grounding our awareness in the living sensation of our bodies that the &amp;#39;I Am,&amp;#39; our real presence, can awaken. ~ G. I. Gurdjieff&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Why Grounding Is Vital&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grounding creates the conditions for using your soul powers and soul senses. Setting your focus on noticing the data that comes via your psychic senses is becoming grounded. When you become grounded, you can analyze both internal and external forces. This is how you get experience in receiving messages from your soulful self.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Establishing the setting, the tone, and your awareness via grounding allows you to accept what is and open up. You must let go of the egoic mind when you ground. You are giving the soul permission to be receptive and perceptive. To do this, you must block out outside stimuli and limit your awareness to the area inside and around you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grounding might happen instantly or take some time, depending on your familiarity with a calm state of mind and even your attitude or energy when trying to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can be as simple as taking a breath, closing your eyes, and focusing above and beyond yourself to enter this state of shutting off the mind&amp;#39;s chatter. People will frequently recommend meditation as a means for you to enhance your awareness and connect with your soul. The goal of meditation is to bring you to a state of groundedness. It calms the mind and helps you concentrate on the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This state of mind primes you to receive messages; it serves as your blank canvas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As with everything in nature, if your life isn&amp;#39;t supported by a grounded source of energy, it will wither and lose its vitality. ~ Sonia Choquette&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Ways To Ground Yourself&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It takes time to learn how being grounded feels for you. I would argue that being in a state of grounding could seem dull yet pleasant, to offer you a few hints of what it might feel like to be in a state of nothingness. You realize things you may not have previously noticed, such as noises, thoughts, or sensations (emotional or physical).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re sitting in it, you could question your presence. Or feel that it should be more complicated or that was too easy. Since humans overthink things, let me say that yes, it really is that simple.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can also have a loss of awareness concerning the passing of time. Time behaves differently when one is grounded, making it a serene environment to get lost in. Here are three simple ways in which you can use to ground yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breathing Exercises&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve ever heard the advice to &amp;quot;take a deep breath,&amp;quot; you know its effectiveness. When you\u2019re stressed, blood pressure begins to increase and other physical symptoms, like sweating, eye twitching, shaking, and other obvious responses, depending on the situation. As you gain emotional control, mindful breathing helps you return your attention to the present. Find a quiet place to practice this simple grounding exercise. Breathe in to the count of five.  Hold your breath for a count of five. And breathe out to a count of five.  Do this three times. Repetition of this technique can help you refocus and remove your emotions from the current scenario. You redirect your thoughts and behaviors in a way that is more beneficial and healthy for you, centering your body and mind on the present.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Body Scan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mentally scan your entire body to get a sense of how you feel from head to toe. Are there any spots that hurt or are uncomfortable? When you aren&amp;#39;t in touch with your senses, it can frequently lead to unusual and/or unfavorable reactions. At these moments, it appears nothing is occurring to you, for you, or around you. You can perform a body scan during a yoga or meditation session or as a fast self-check when you&amp;#39;re in a challenging circumstance and your emotions are running high. If anything feels out of balance, pay attention to your intuition about how it may be corrected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Gratitude Meditation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Daily meditation and gratitude-focused thinking are powerful tools for maintaining your sense of grounding. It requires at least a short period of focused awareness. List your blessings in writing or say them out loud. Some individuals find it beneficial to set an intention when practicing meditation because it gives them something to focus on. It sets the tone for the day when you begin it with clarity of thought and peace of mind. Try to return as often as you can to the present moment as your day goes on. Close your eyes and pay attention to the sounds, scents, and visuals you are taking in when you feel your energy shifting. Detailing circumstances might help you understand why you desire to behave a specific way and reduce stress reactions. It enables you to grow internally by helping you connect more with your true, soulful self.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We can go through our five senses in about a minute\u2019s time to become grounded in the present, and we can do this anytime we find ourselves in worry or speculation. Becoming grounded in our present makes us available to happiness. ~ Jeff Kober&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Moving Forward While Being Grounded&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every instant offers you the chance to exercise your choice of being actively involved in being fully present or oblivious to it. The practice of grounding involves returning to your core. It does not imply a constant calm or absence of negative feelings. When difficulties throw you off track, it gives you a method to remain calm while regaining equilibrium, and it helps you build stronger bonds with both yourself and other people. By using grounding practices, you act more intentionally and prevent negativity from dragging you down. You feel you have more control and are in balance by practicing techniques like mindful breathing, body scanning, and daily gratitude reflections.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are inclined to make decisions that are consistent with your soulful self when you choose to be fully present in the moment. Getting in tune with love, connection, compassion, and empathy leads to decisions that feel aligned with your soul. You develop the capacity to appreciate your genuine rhythm and feel a natural, relaxing flow in both your internal and exterior worlds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When rooted and grounded in The Divine, you can rise above every misery. ~ Tirzah Libert&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "8723247e-1e96-11ed-94d7-0eabd5e537a3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmbm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#ffb000", "id": "yiuezr", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TerriMKozlowski", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfimprovement/comments/yiuezr/being_grounded_is_a_powerful_and_positive_way_to/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/yiuezr/being_grounded_is_a_powerful_and_positive_way_to/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1352066, "created_utc": 1667264448.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfimprovement", "selftext": "I\u2019m in my 30s haven\u2019t had as many sexual partners as I would have liked to feel worthwhile compared to my peers, never had their level of drive to succeed and even now I still can\u2019t get either.

about me: i would say i was \"depressed\" for the majority of my teenage years (im 16 now)\n\nlooking back it is pretty obvious rhat i wasnt really depressed, but i just felt like shit, because i was a loser\n\ni rember one particular night, when i actually wanted to commit suicide, however i was just afraid of dying tho. every morning i woke up feeling like shit, wishing i didnt wake up.\nnow i want to say that your environment does affect you a lot, if you around people who want to split their veins, there ks a high chance that you are giong to do the same.\n\nthe thing that helped me most was this: rage! pure fucking rage, but not towards like people, i didnt beat anybody up, or harm myself, kr hate anybody, but i would say that it was a Fuck This Event (as MJ Demarco would call it), but kt was more like a process, it didnt happen over time. i remember back then i used to use a lot of social media, and i went about it the same way as everyone else. \n\nI was envoius of al those succesful people with lean bodies and nice cars, girls etc\nover time i just developed a certain mindset, and i remember that one night i just litelary told my self that:\nfuck that shit, why does this guy has all the women and i dont, why does he have the cars and the houses and the money, and i dont\n\nthis was the peak of the fuck this process\n\nlitelary that night i just googled \"home workout\" and started doing fucking chair dipsxd\nbut it was proggres, i litelary made 0 productive thing before that\n\ni was still depressed and sad, but i kept sticking to working out, and over time i adopted mode productive things: reading, meditating, journaling, nofap, dopamine detox\ni did the good things for litelary half a year, and now i dont drink alcohol in my sadness, i dont think about suicide, and one really important thing also: i dont believe in depression\n\nof course i know for a fact, that i can feel depressed, however i do not believe that depression is a genetical disease, and you are unable to change it. the power of your beliefes are more powerful than you actually dare to think\n\nthats it\n6 months of self improvement can beat years of depression",

for the majority of my teenage years (im 16 now)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;looking back it is pretty obvious rhat i wasnt really depressed, but i just felt like shit, because i was a loser&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i rember one particular night, when i actually wanted to commit suicide, however i was just afraid of dying tho. every morning i woke up feeling like shit, wishing i didnt wake up.\nnow i want to say that your environment does affect you a lot, if you around people who want to split their veins, there ks a high chance that you are giong to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the thing that helped me most was this: rage! pure fucking rage, but not towards like people, i didnt beat anybody up, or harm myself, kr hate anybody, but i would say that it was a Fuck This Event (as MJ Demarco would call it), but kt was more like a process, it didnt happen over time. i remember back then i used to use a lot of social media, and i went about it the same way as everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was envoius of al those succesful people with lean bodies and nice cars, girls etc\nover time i just developed a certain mindset, and i remember that one night i just litelary told my self that:\nfuck that shit, why does this guy has all the women and i dont, why does he have the cars and the houses and the money, and i dont&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;this was the peak of the fuck this process&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;litelary that night i just googled &amp;quot;home workout&amp;quot; and started doing fucking chair dipsxd\nbut it was proggres, i litelary made 0 productive thing before that&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i was still depressed and sad, but i kept sticking to working out, and over time i adopted mode productive things: reading, meditating, journaling, nofap, dopamine detox\ni did the good things for litelary half a year, and now i dont drink alcohol in my sadness, i dont think about suicide, and one really important thing also: i dont believe in depression&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;of course i know for a fact, that i can feel depressed, however i do not believe that depression is a genetical disease, and you are unable to change it. the power of your beliefes are more powerful than you actually dare to think&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;thats it\n6 months of self improvement can beat years of depression&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable":

Both earned great possessions.\n\nHowever one had financial issues all his life. The other became one of the richest people in Hawaii.\n\nOne had the habit of saying \u201cWhen it comes to money play it safe\u201d. The other one used to say \u201cLearn how to control risk\u201d\n\nOne used to say \u201cStudy hard so you can one day find a good company to work in\u201d However the other one said \u201cStudy hard so you can one day find a good company to buy\u201d\n\nOne died leaving behind him tens of millions of dollars to his family, charities and churches.\n\nThe other one died leaving unpaid bills.\n\nRobert had the ability to listen to both of his fathers. But at the age of 9 Robert chose to listen to his rich dad and had to stop listening to his poor dad even though he was the one with the college degrees.\n\nRobert said \u201cMost of us learn about money from our parents. What can a poor parent teach his child about money?\u201d\n\nI think we can learn a lot from the mistakes of a poor person. And that is exactly what we are going to do today.\n\n### INTRO\n\nEarly on in Robert\u2019s life he was interested about money since he was living in a nice neighborhood and saw people driving nice cars he wanted to know how he can be rich.\n\nWhen Robert was 9 years old he asked his poor father \u201cDad, can you tell me how to get rich?\u201d\n\nObviously a poor dad can\u2019t teach anyone how to become rich and how to make money.\n\nHis poor dad was more focused on getting the best education and the best universities that he didn\u2019t even have time to think about learning about money. He has gotten all his education about money from people that are poor and are professors for a living.\n\nHowever his dad tells him that his best friend\u2019s father is a rich man and can make a lot of money brilliantly.\n\nRobert and his friend Mike wanted to become rich so they went to to Mike\u2019s father to learn from him. He was the most successful and rich people in Hawaii at the time.\n\nThat is when Robert met the man that would change his life his \u201cRich Dad\u201d.\n\nThis man is the man that taught Robert how to view money and how to **make money work for him.** He also taught him what the rich do different from the poor and the mistakes that the poor make in their lives.\n\nThe first lesson his rich dad taught him was that \u201cThe rich don\u2019t work for money\u201d\n\n### MISTAKE 1: LETTING MONEY, FEAR &amp; IGNORANCE CONTROL YOUR LIFE\n\nPeople have a fear of being broke and that fear drives them to a pay-check. They think that more money will make them happier however that doesn\u2019t happen. That fear traps them in an infinite loop of working, getting a pay-check, working, getting a pay-check. And they always hope that the fear will disappear.\n\n\u201cThe poor and middle class work for money. The rich have made money to work for them\u201d is what MIke\u2019s dad, the rich dad told them their first day studying from him\n\nRobert learned from the rich dad that the reason the poor accept low paying jobs and do not try to get out of the rat race is because of their belief that it is better to play it safe with money.\n\nAnd when they do that they are not lead by passion but by fear.\n\n**RICH PEOPLE DON\u2019T WORK FOR A PAY-CHECK** \\- The pay-check is the biggest trap you can fall into.\n\n**MONEY CONTROLS THEIR LIFES NOW** \\- their feelings and from there their souls. Because of the loop we discussed earlier the poor and middle class are stuck from pay-check to pay-check in the rat race.\n\nHIS POOR DAD made the mistake of being afraid and that fear he let in his life ruled over him forever.\n\nHe told Robert that he should study hard, get good grades in school and he would find a good and stable job to work in.\n\nHowever he didn\u2019t tell Robert that because it is the best solution or the best thing to do but because he was AFRAID that Robert wouldn\u2019t be able to earn money just as he was afraid for himself too.\n\nThe main reason of poorness is fear and ignorance. Fear and ignorance of money and how it works is a recipe for poorness.\n\nFear gets empowered by ignorance and makes it more powerful.\n\nDon\u2019t let fear anywhere near you and learn to control risks.\n\nLearn to use your emotions to think don\u2019t think with your emotions.\n\nMost of the people miss money making opportunities because they are chasing money and stability, and that is exactly what they get. And don\u2019t let this mistake happen in your own life.\n\n### MISTAKE 2: NOT BEING FINANCIALLY LITERATE\n\nIf you are planning on building a sky scrapper you have to dig deep to build the foundations first.\n\nIf you are not financially literate how can you expect to know how to make money and become rich.\n\n**Rule 1 of financial literacy:**\n\n**Know the difference between an asset and a liability and buy assets**\n\nIt is a simple thing to do, however it seems so hard to a lot of people.\n\nAll you have to do to get rich is learn the difference between asset and liability.\n\nAnd then stop buying liabilities and buy assets.\n\nRich people get assets, poor people get liabilities thinking those are assets.\n\nAssets get money in your pocket, liabilities take money from your pocket.\n\nThe knowledge that people miss is not about how to earn money but how to control and manage their money, what they do with it after they earn it.\n\nThat is called financial literacy - what you do with your money when you earn it, how you save it from other trying to take it from you, how long can you save it for and how good does that money work for you.\n\nWhen choosing an asset to buy study it and don\u2019t let the masses influence your choice. Instead of believing in themselves most of the people let other people influence their decisions. (social media, news, politicians, friends, parents)\n\nThe more you learn about money, the more you will get away from professors and other peers and start to see the world for what it truly is.\n\nThis is exactly how the rich get richer. The money coming in from the assets can pay all of their expenses and have left to reinvest and buy more assets. Making the income from the assets even bigger and making the rich richer.\n\nInvesting is not risky for a financially literate person that knows what is an asset and what is a liability. So get to learning right now.\n\n### MISTAKE 3: FOCUSED ON INCOME NOT ON ASSETS\n\nRich people are focused on their assets, poor people are focused on their income.\n\nPoor people don\u2019t think ahead. And if you are one of those people go back and rewatch the last segment where we talked about financial literacy. And to be fair if you want to learn even more buy the book and read it.\n\nYou should work and you should keep your employment and get your income. However you will have to focus more on assets and building your asset column stronger with each bit of money entering your income column.\n\nKeep your job and buy assets don\u2019t buy liabilities. Poor people think their car is an asset but the average car once it is bought has a drop in value of 25%. Research and think for yourself what are assets and what will grow in value once I buy it.\n\nKeep a low level of expenses, lower your liabilities and buy a strong foundation of assets.\n\nRobert suggest the following 8 types of assets:\n\n* **Business that don\u2019t need you to be in office.** Other people manage it and work for you. If you had to go to work there then it isn\u2019t an asset.\n* **Securities**\n* **Bonds**\n* **Investing companies**\n* **Real estate that brings income**\n* **Promissory notes**\n* **Copyrights** \\- music, books, patents\n* **Anything else that has value, brings income or is appreciated in the market**\n\n### MISTAKE 4: NOT KNOWING ABOUT TAXES AND CORPORATIONS\n\nThe rich are not taxed. The rich will never be taxed. The rich are smart and can get away with things easily. The rich can adapt fast to new circumstances, laws and obligations.\n\nThe rich do this by creating working places for the poor and middle class, then the governments make laws to make it easier for the rich to do this. This initiates from the governments lower the taxes from the rich and the governments have to tax the poor and middle class more in order to make their tax income.\n\nThis may be difficult to understand but the easy way to understand it is that the rich get help from governments in order to create housing and job opportunities for the poor and middle class. And because the governments help the rich they have to tax the poor in order to make their money because they are taking less from the rich.\n\nThe rich do this through the power of corporations and government deals.\n\nHow to get away and pay less in taxes you might ask. Well the tax collector is coming what are you going to do? He is going to take as much money as he can from you. However if you are willing to invest the tax laws will work in your favour. If you only want to spend money and buy liabilities the tax laws will work against you.\n\nYou need to learn the laws around taxing, investing and income in your own country. You need to learn how the system works in order to be able to keep the most money you can for yourself and give the least to the tax collector.\n\nThe rich dad always had smarter people working for him. People who daily read the laws and news and find new loopholes for him to use. He would pay those people top dollar however the amount of money they saved him over the years was enormous.\n\nRobert says that the coefficient of financial intelligence the sum of these 4 areas of expertise:\n\n1. **Accounting** \\- knowledge of numbers\n2. **Investing** \\- knowledge of making money, strategies and formulas\n3. **Understanding the market** \\- know what is worth buying or selling\n4. **The Law** \\- tax reliefs &amp; protection from court proceedings\n\nThe main power of the corporations is that: corporations can have income then spend everything it can and then gets taxed on anything that is left. It\u2019s one of the biggest law loopholes in the system and rich people use it everyday.\n\n### MISTAKE 5: SHELTERING YOUR FINANCIAL GENIUS\n\nYour genius is getting sheltered whether you want it or not. You have been led by fear your whole life and if you do not get yourself up and try and risk you will forever be stuck in a rat race for your next pay-check.\n\nIf you want to make money instead of getting yourself beat everyday at work you have to have financial intelligence. However if you are the kind of person that waits for the perfect moment you maybe stay there waiting a very long time. As it say in the book it is like going on a road-trip and waiting for all the traffic lights 5 miles ahead to be green in order to start.\n\n**The most powerful asset we own is our brain. If it is trained good, it can create enormous wealth.**\n\n*Which option seems harder?*\n\n1. Work hard, pay 50% tax and save the rest. Your savings earn 5% which gets taxed again.\n2. Make a little time for extending your financial intelligence and harness the power of your brain and the asset column.\n\nIf you know what you are doing, investing is not gambling. However if you just put some money in investment and you just sit there and pray to God it doesn\u2019t fail then it is gambling.\n\nYou also shelter your financial genius by not trying, by not failing. That is why school is a stupid place. In school they teach you that mistakes are bad and they punish you for them. However if you think about it if you never fall you will never learn to walk. The same goes for investing if you never fail you will never learn how to invest.\n\nThe things you know are your biggest riches. The things you don\u2019t know are your biggest risks.\n\nRisk always exist, so learn to control it and avoid it.\n\n### MISTAKE 6: DON\u2019T WORK FOR MONEY WORK FOR KNOWLEDGE\n\n\u201cA stable job meant everything for my educated father,\n\nLearning meant everything for my rich dad.\u201d - Robert said at the start of the last lesson of the book.\n\nWhat he means by that is that yes maybe his poor dad knew more about one subject than his rich dad. But his rich dad knew about more subjects than his poor dad. And that is what is important.\n\nKnowing a little knowledge from a lot of things is power.\n\nPeople would rather work in a dead-end job because of an upcoming possibility for a promotion than quitting and working for more knowledge.\n\nThere is a really good scene in Jerry Maguire where Tom Cruise got fired from his company and asks the people there \u201cWho\u2019s coming with me?\u201d and no one answers him but a woman who stands up and says \u201cI would but I\u2019m getting a pay increase in 3 months\u201d\n\nAnother example is that people say that they can make a better hamburger than McDonalds but they are too focused on learning about hamburgers than about learning selling and marketing.\n\nPoor people don\u2019t realise that a specialisation in a field, the narrower it is, the more it entraps a person and gets them in a more dependent position.\n\nIn order to manage you will need to have knowledge from this fields:\n\n* cash flow management\n* system management\n* people management\n\n### HOW TO GET OVER OBSTACLES\n\nThere are 5 reasons why financially literate people sometimes don\u2019t succeed in creating a solid assets column that generates income:\n\n1. Fear\n2. Cynicism\n3. Laziness\n4. Bad habits\n5. Arrogance\n\n**GETTING OVER FEAR**\n\nTHE ONLY WAY to get over fear is by failing. Failure paralyses losers but inspires winners.\n\nThe reason why 90% of Americans have financial issues is because they are playing to not lose.\n\nThey aren\u2019t playing to win.\n\n**GETTING OVER CYNICISM**\n\nBecause of fear and listening to fearful individuals you may not even start investing in an asset column. If you always listen to your friends and family you will never make a move and try something.\n\nSmart investors know that when it looks like the worse time to make money it is actually the best time.\n\n**GETTING OVER LAZINESS**\n\nIf you have watched this video to this point I would say you have understood the power of this book. If I hadn\u2019t read this book I would have never gotten all this knowledge. So why would you be lazy? Why would you lay in bed all day or look at TikTok? Were you born in to this word to do just that? Or do you have a bigger purpose?\n\n**GETTING OVER BAD HABITS**\n\nThe rich dad used to always pay himself first and that way he would always have to hustle and find other ways to pay the tax collectors at the end of the month.

Both earned great possessions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However one had financial issues all his life. The other became one of the richest people in Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One had the habit of saying \u201cWhen it comes to money play it safe\u201d. The other one used to say \u201cLearn how to control risk\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One used to say \u201cStudy hard so you can one day find a good company to work in\u201d However the other one said \u201cStudy hard so you can one day find a good company to buy\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One died leaving behind him tens of millions of dollars to his family, charities and churches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other one died leaving unpaid bills.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robert had the ability to listen to both of his fathers. But at the age of 9 Robert chose to listen to his rich dad and had to stop listening to his poor dad even though he was the one with the college degrees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robert said \u201cMost of us learn about money from our parents. What can a poor parent teach his child about money?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think we can learn a lot from the mistakes of a poor person. And that is exactly what we are going to do today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;INTRO&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Early on in Robert\u2019s life he was interested about money since he was living in a nice neighborhood and saw people driving nice cars he wanted to know how he can be rich.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Robert was 9 years old he asked his poor father \u201cDad, can you tell me how to get rich?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously a poor dad can\u2019t teach anyone how to become rich and how to make money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His poor dad was more focused on getting the best education and the best universities that he didn\u2019t even have time to think about learning about money. He has gotten all his education about money from people that are poor and are professors for a living.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However his dad tells him that his best friend\u2019s father is a rich man and can make a lot of money brilliantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robert and his friend Mike wanted to become rich so they went to to Mike\u2019s father to learn from him. He was the most successful and rich people in Hawaii at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is when Robert met the man that would change his life his \u201cRich Dad\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This man is the man that taught Robert how to view money and how to &lt;strong&gt;make money work for him.&lt;/strong&gt; He also taught him what the rich do different from the poor and the mistakes that the poor make in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first lesson his rich dad taught him was that \u201cThe rich don\u2019t work for money\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;MISTAKE 1: LETTING MONEY, FEAR &amp;amp; IGNORANCE CONTROL YOUR LIFE&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People have a fear of being broke and that fear drives them to a pay-check. They think that more money will make them happier however that doesn\u2019t happen. That fear traps them in an infinite loop of working, getting a pay-check, working, getting a pay-check. And they always hope that the fear will disappear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe poor and middle class work for money. The rich have made money to work for them\u201d is what MIke\u2019s dad, the rich dad told them their first day studying from him&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robert learned from the rich dad that the reason the poor accept low paying jobs and do not try to get out of the rat race is because of their belief that it is better to play it safe with money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when they do that they are not lead by passion but by fear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RICH PEOPLE DON\u2019T WORK FOR A PAY-CHECK&lt;/strong&gt; - The pay-check is the biggest trap you can fall into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MONEY CONTROLS THEIR LIFES NOW&lt;/strong&gt; - their feelings and from there their souls. Because of the loop we discussed earlier the poor and middle class are stuck from pay-check to pay-check in the rat race.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;HIS POOR DAD made the mistake of being afraid and that fear he let in his life ruled over him forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He told Robert that he should study hard, get good grades in school and he would find a good and stable job to work in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However he didn\u2019t tell Robert that because it is the best solution or the best thing to do but because he was AFRAID that Robert wouldn\u2019t be able to earn money just as he was afraid for himself too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main reason of poorness is fear and ignorance. Fear and ignorance of money and how it works is a recipe for poorness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fear gets empowered by ignorance and makes it more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t let fear anywhere near you and learn to control risks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Learn to use your emotions to think don\u2019t think with your emotions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of the people miss money making opportunities because they are chasing money and stability, and that is exactly what they get. And don\u2019t let this mistake happen in your own life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;MISTAKE 2: NOT BEING FINANCIALLY LITERATE&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are planning on building a sky scrapper you have to dig deep to build the foundations first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are not financially literate how can you expect to know how to make money and become rich.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 1 of financial literacy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know the difference between an asset and a liability and buy assets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is a simple thing to do, however it seems so hard to a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All you have to do to get rich is learn the difference between asset and liability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then stop buying liabilities and buy assets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rich people get assets, poor people get liabilities thinking those are assets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Assets get money in your pocket, liabilities take money from your pocket.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The knowledge that people miss is not about how to earn money but how to control and manage their money, what they do with it after they earn it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is called financial literacy - what you do with your money when you earn it, how you save it from other trying to take it from you, how long can you save it for and how good does that money work for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When choosing an asset to buy study it and don\u2019t let the masses influence your choice. Instead of believing in themselves most of the people let other people influence their decisions. (social media, news, politicians, friends, parents)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The more you learn about money, the more you will get away from professors and other peers and start to see the world for what it truly is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is exactly how the rich get richer. The money coming in from the assets can pay all of their expenses and have left to reinvest and buy more assets. Making the income from the assets even bigger and making the rich richer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Investing is not risky for a financially literate person that knows what is an asset and what is a liability. So get to learning right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;MISTAKE 3: FOCUSED ON INCOME NOT ON ASSETS&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rich people are focused on their assets, poor people are focused on their income.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Poor people don\u2019t think ahead. And if you are one of those people go back and rewatch the last segment where we talked about financial literacy. And to be fair if you want to learn even more buy the book and read it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You should work and you should keep your employment and get your income. However you will have to focus more on assets and building your asset column stronger with each bit of money entering your income column.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep your job and buy assets don\u2019t buy liabilities. Poor people think their car is an asset but the average car once it is bought has a drop in value of 25%. Research and think for yourself what are assets and what will grow in value once I buy it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep a low level of expenses, lower your liabilities and buy a strong foundation of assets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robert suggest the following 8 types of assets:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business that don\u2019t need you to be in office.&lt;/strong&gt; Other people manage it and work for you. If you had to go to work there then it isn\u2019t an asset.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Securities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investing companies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real estate that brings income&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promissory notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copyrights&lt;/strong&gt; - music, books, patents&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anything else that has value, brings income or is appreciated in the market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;MISTAKE 4: NOT KNOWING ABOUT TAXES AND CORPORATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rich are not taxed. The rich will never be taxed. The rich are smart and can get away with things easily. The rich can adapt fast to new circumstances, laws and obligations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rich do this by creating working places for the poor and middle class, then the governments make laws to make it easier for the rich to do this. This initiates from the governments lower the taxes from the rich and the governments have to tax the poor and middle class more in order to make their tax income.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This may be difficult to understand but the easy way to understand it is that the rich get help from governments in order to create housing and job opportunities for the poor and middle class. And because the governments help the rich they have to tax the poor in order to make their money because they are taking less from the rich.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rich do this through the power of corporations and government deals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How to get away and pay less in taxes you might ask. Well the tax collector is coming what are you going to do? He is going to take as much money as he can from you. However if you are willing to invest the tax laws will work in your favour. If you only want to spend money and buy liabilities the tax laws will work against you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need to learn the laws around taxing, investing and income in your own country. You need to learn how the system works in order to be able to keep the most money you can for yourself and give the least to the tax collector.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rich dad always had smarter people working for him. People who daily read the laws and news and find new loopholes for him to use. He would pay those people top dollar however the amount of money they saved him over the years was enormous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robert says that the coefficient of financial intelligence the sum of these 4 areas of expertise:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accounting&lt;/strong&gt; - knowledge of numbers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investing&lt;/strong&gt; - knowledge of making money, strategies and formulas&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding the market&lt;/strong&gt; - know what is worth buying or selling&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Law&lt;/strong&gt; - tax reliefs &amp;amp; protection from court proceedings&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main power of the corporations is that: corporations can have income then spend everything it can and then gets taxed on anything that is left. It\u2019s one of the biggest law loopholes in the system and rich people use it everyday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;MISTAKE 5: SHELTERING YOUR FINANCIAL GENIUS&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your genius is getting sheltered whether you want it or not. You have been led by fear your whole life and if you do not get yourself up and try and risk you will forever be stuck in a rat race for your next pay-check.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to make money instead of getting yourself beat everyday at work you have to have financial intelligence. However if you are the kind of person that waits for the perfect moment you maybe stay there waiting a very long time. As it say in the book it is like going on a road-trip and waiting for all the traffic lights 5 miles ahead to be green in order to start.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The most powerful asset we own is our brain. If it is trained good, it can create enormous wealth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which option seems harder?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work hard, pay 50% tax and save the rest. Your savings earn 5% which gets taxed again.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Make a little time for extending your financial intelligence and harness the power of your brain and the asset column.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you know what you are doing, investing is not gambling. However if you just put some money in investment and you just sit there and pray to God it doesn\u2019t fail then it is gambling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You also shelter your financial genius by not trying, by not failing. That is why school is a stupid place. In school they teach you that mistakes are bad and they punish you for them. However if you think about it if you never fall you will never learn to walk. The same goes for investing if you never fail you will never learn how to invest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The things you know are your biggest riches. The things you don\u2019t know are your biggest risks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Risk always exist, so learn to control it and avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;MISTAKE 6: DON\u2019T WORK FOR MONEY WORK FOR KNOWLEDGE&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cA stable job meant everything for my educated father,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Learning meant everything for my rich dad.\u201d - Robert said at the start of the last lesson of the book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What he means by that is that yes maybe his poor dad knew more about one subject than his rich dad. But his rich dad knew about more subjects than his poor dad. And that is what is important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Knowing a little knowledge from a lot of things is power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People would rather work in a dead-end job because of an upcoming possibility for a promotion than quitting and working for more knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a really good scene in Jerry Maguire where Tom Cruise got fired from his company and asks the people there \u201cWho\u2019s coming with me?\u201d and no one answers him but a woman who stands up and says \u201cI would but I\u2019m getting a pay increase in 3 months\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another example is that people say that they can make a better hamburger than McDonalds but they are too focused on learning about hamburgers than about learning selling and marketing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Poor people don\u2019t realise that a specialisation in a field, the narrower it is, the more it entraps a person and gets them in a more dependent position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In order to manage you will need to have knowledge from this fields:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;cash flow management&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;system management&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;people management&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;HOW TO GET OVER OBSTACLES&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are 5 reasons why financially literate people sometimes don\u2019t succeed in creating a solid assets column that generates income:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fear&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cynicism&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Laziness&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bad habits&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Arrogance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GETTING OVER FEAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THE ONLY WAY to get over fear is by failing. Failure paralyses losers but inspires winners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason why 90% of Americans have financial issues is because they are playing to not lose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They aren\u2019t playing to win.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GETTING OVER CYNICISM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because of fear and listening to fearful individuals you may not even start investing in an asset column. If you always listen to your friends and family you will never make a move and try something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Smart investors know that when it looks like the worse time to make money it is actually the best time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GETTING OVER LAZINESS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have watched this video to this point I would say you have understood the power of this book. If I hadn\u2019t read this book I would have never gotten all this knowledge. So why would you be lazy? Why would you lay in bed all day or look at TikTok? Were you born in to this word to do just that?

So that emotion is now locked in your body, which causes problems with your physical and spiritual self. Cause the energy cant flow through your body freely!\n\nI look at trauma as a fraction of your spirit/soul/self. Like you are not connected with your inner child (at least in my experience, because my trauma happened when I was a child).\n\n**In my experience my untreated trauma left me with;**\n\n* Hating myself, despising myself\n* Thinking no one loves me / I am alone\n* Anxiety\n* Depression\n* Negative thoughts\n* Harmful Addictions (One of the root causes of overuse of drugs and alcohol is untreated trauma, I used drugs and alcohol to cope with the pain)\n* PAIN\n\nMy benefits of curing trauma are immeasurable (because many things happened in between), but it lead me to Happiness, Peace, Loving Myself, Finding and understanding who loves me and who is my true support, curing depression, Positive more confident thoughts, and beliefs, Less and less anxiety, dealing with stress better, Understanding myself, what I want to do, life, everything much much better, Better control and expression of emotions... and so much more.\n\nSo if you have trauma treat it immediately cause this is what probably is holding you and your success. So I would recommend you treat, it will be life-changing!\n\n**Here is my story, what cause my trauma, and how I treated it:**\n\n**How I got traumatized;**\n\nMy Father first divorced my mother and then killed himself. (Divorce is enough trauma for the child because the child inherently thinks it's his fault, an abstinent parent in the household is always bad as well....+ you probably thought as a child your father and mother were soulmates, or something like that (I did))\n\n**How long it went:**\n\nBecause I was hiding from the fact I was depressed, (I didn't want to admit it as a young boy that I was depressed and shit, though it was a correct way to go) my depression, anxiety, and just a shitty existence, existence full of coping and the pain went as long as for 12 years. After 12 years, information that I am traumatized came to me by accident. 2 years have passed from this information!\n\nAfter the realization that I am traumatized, I started to inquire and learn more about trauma, and I have started to treat it... myself, (without antidepressants, modern cures for depression and psychologists) with information that was either in books, the internet, or within myself! (But that is me, to each his own, there is no shame in seeking help! I say that I did it alone so you can see its curable, even when DIY)\n\n**How I treated trauma:**\n\n* A lot of writing, with pen and paper... **DO NOT DO IT ON A COMPUTER**... writing forgiveness letters to my father, family, younger self, journaling, writing eulogies, writing promises, feelings... just writing what I wanted to (You can also burn the letters after if you want).\n* And then when I wrote, feelings came back, feelings of sadness and sorrow, the feelings I have been avoiding half of my life. **THIS IS IMPORTANT**, When those feelings came up I didn't avoid them, I didn't bury them inside, I just felt them and stood with them, when I wanted to cry I cried. And this caused me to feel sad for like 2 months, and I cried a lot during those 2 months, but after a while, I stopped crying and everything was kinda mellow then. It was alright!\n* Visualization before sleeping. I visualized myself as a kid(when it happened), and as an adult, in both the same place and time (LIKE THE PICTURE BELOW!). And I talked and felt like an adult, and I talked and felt like a kid. I Visualized kid me separated from my current self, and me jumping down the deep dark hole (let's say rabbit hole), to come and rescue the kid. Connect me and myself! Aka my fragmented spirit. This also caused a lot of crying\n\n**What I said to my kid and what also helped me treat my trauma:**\n\n* Understand that the negative things needed to happen, it was destiny, and it's what will make you great! I don't know a one truly great person who had an easy life. Because that happened you have the opportunity now to heal yourself, and then help others heal themselves!\n* You reacted the best way you could to the situation, do not hate yourself for the reaction, it's good you survived for so long, alone. You did a good job, I am proud of you! (you're never really alone, though the Cosmos is always with you)\n* Forgiveness, forgive your father because he was alone as well, he didn't know better, he was in probably more trouble and turmoil than you are, were.\n* I will guard and protect you, now you can relax, you are safe with me!\n\n**Honorable notice:**\n\n* I started to return to nature and started to spend more time in nature and less time in front of a screen or in a cafe. **MAN IS NATURE!**\n* Also, this is my view on them, maybe you have a different view, but they helped me change my life for the better (I used them twice) MUSHROOMS. I had two sessions with mushrooms, and it helped me to understand life and myself better. I asked mushrooms for knowledge, and they gave me knowledge! \\*I Don't think you should take mushrooms or anything like that, everyone is their own person, to me, it worked, to you it may worsen the situation, who knows, **do what suits you**\"\n\n**Knowledge is the Truth and the Truth Heals!** **Knowledge Heals!**\n\nAlso, mushrooms are now researched and used for healing mental illness in some psychological institutes, in exchange for anti-depressants and modern pills! Google it if you doubt me. Also, they were tested before as well in the 50s 60s in America, but it was shut down by the Government.\n\nI hope this will be helpful! If you have any questions write in the comments or DM me if you're shy!\n\nGood luck my brothers and sisters!

I also wanted to be fit, as I think that looking into the mirror and feeling proud of something is a wonderful thing, it would create momentum of me growing and it also would give me prestige (Yes, I care about prestige, I know it&amp;#39;s kinda lame but I&amp;#39;m me and I would rather respect how my mind feels and what it wants then just suppress it.)&lt;br/&gt;\nSince then I&amp;#39;ve been working on my dreams like hell, and I now founded my own company with a friend, just launched a Drinking/Party Game App: &amp;quot;Appyshot&amp;quot; (If you wanna try it out it&amp;#39;s great and free :b) which in not even a month was already TOP7 app in entertainment here in Portugal, overtaking all major TV channels and games. And I&amp;#39;m know in the best shape of my life, receiving several compliments and I&amp;#39;m so happy and hungry for more achievements. I don&amp;#39;t know if I will be successful, but just knowing that I&amp;#39;m out here, on my way, doing the best I can, is an incredible feeling and I am now happier than ever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope this motivates someone, especially someone that might be at a low point in life right now, someone that may feel like I felt &amp;quot;as an average guy&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;\nMerry Christmas everybody!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [{"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": null, "coin_price": 100, "id": "gid_1", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "GLOBAL", "coin_reward": 0, "icon_url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_512.png", "days_of_premium": null, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_16.png", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_32.png", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_48.png", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_64.png", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_128.png", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 512, "static_icon_width": 512, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "Shows the Silver Award... and that's it.", "end_date": null, "sticky_duration_seconds": null, "subreddit_coin_reward": 0, "count": 1, "static_icon_height": 512, "name": "Silver", "resized_static_icons": [{"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_16.png", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_32.png", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_48.png", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_64.png", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_128.png", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_format": null, "icon_height": 512, "penny_price": null, "award_type": "global", "static_icon_url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_512.png"}], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmbm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "rnp45u", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MrVazzyVazz", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 15, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfimprovement/comments/rnp45u/i_turned_my_life_around_and_its_f_awesome/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/rnp45u/i_turned_my_life_around_and_its_f_awesome/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1352066, "created_utc": 1640361681.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfimprovement", "selftext": "After a long break of computer games I watched a youtube video of someone playing a game, so I decided to try it myself.

A few months back, I ended up getting popular on some streaming app I got and it was kinda shocking considering that's NEVER happened to me. I was always used to being ignored, made fun of, or being alone. I was pretty much a social reject because of my appearance and odd quirky interests I had, which was just liking anime or nerd stuff. I did act weird sometimes, but it was my appearance that was really fucked with. I was always the ugly loser girl that no one wanted to sit with at lunch. Everyone avoided my gaze, never heard me when I spoke, or laughed at me the moment I opened my mouth to say literally ANYTHING. I was called every name in the book..\n\n Needless to say I wasn't popular, and was used to that. So when this happened to me.. It made me feel.. I guess powerful? For the first time in my life I felt like I was heard and appreciated. This kinda made me spiral into getting this \"high\" to make me feel better about myself. My self esteem has always been in the gutter, and getting called \"pretty\" and \"gorgeous\" by random strangers (which never happened before) felt amazing to me. I ended up acting on my impulses, to seek even more validation, by becoming desirable to others, I did something incredibly stupid and sent nude photos of me to them (without my face in it). It felt good in the moment, I'm not gonna lie, but after it was done, I felt shame and disgust. I felt gross.. And I hated that, so I just kept pushing that feeling inside me and kept doing it to feel that sort of \"high\".\n\n Am I a mess? Yeah. Do I need help? Definitely... Am I rambling too much? 100% but I just felt the need to get this out here any way I can... Because I feel like I owe people.. I've hurt quite a few people in my life.. Mainly unintentionally. after everything, my partner ended up finding out about it, and I admitted everything right away. It was like a relief.. But I also felt disgusted even more to the point where I wanted to vomit. \n\nI never wanted to have that label on me.. A \"cheater\". I hate labels so God damn much... But it's true. I did cheat. I have so many regrets.. Not being able to tell him because I was terrified of losing the one person I cared for most.. Having him find out by doing that.. Etc. Those people that I did that with, I cared for, but they definitely weren't important to me to an enormous degree. I couldn't even hardly get off sexually to it due to my medications. It was like a huge pathetic ego boost.\n\nI don't really know why I'm saying all this, but I need to ask.. Am I a bad person? Because dear God, do I feel like one.

A few months back, I ended up getting popular on some streaming app I got and it was kinda shocking considering that&amp;#39;s NEVER happened to me. I was always used to being ignored, made fun of, or being alone. I was pretty much a social reject because of my appearance and odd quirky interests I had, which was just liking anime or nerd stuff. I did act weird sometimes, but it was my appearance that was really fucked with. I was always the ugly loser girl that no one wanted to sit with at lunch. Everyone avoided my gaze, never heard me when I spoke, or laughed at me the moment I opened my mouth to say literally ANYTHING. I was called every name in the book..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Needless to say I wasn&amp;#39;t popular, and was used to that. So when this happened to me.. It made me feel.. I guess powerful? For the first time in my life I felt like I was heard and appreciated. This kinda made me spiral into getting this &amp;quot;high&amp;quot; to make me feel better about myself. My self esteem has always been in the gutter, and getting called &amp;quot;pretty&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;gorgeous&amp;quot; by random strangers (which never happened before) felt amazing to me. I ended up acting on my impulses, to seek even more validation, by becoming desirable to others, I did something incredibly stupid and sent nude photos of me to them (without my face in it). It felt good in the moment, I&amp;#39;m not gonna lie, but after it was done, I felt shame and disgust. I felt gross.. And I hated that, so I just kept pushing that feeling inside me and kept doing it to feel that sort of &amp;quot;high&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am I a mess? Yeah. Do I need help? Definitely... Am I rambling too much? 100% but I just felt the need to get this out here any way I can... Because I feel like I owe people.. I&amp;#39;ve hurt quite a few people in my life.. Mainly unintentionally. after everything, my partner ended up finding out about it, and I admitted everything right away. It was like a relief.. But I also felt disgusted even more to the point where I wanted to vomit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never wanted to have that label on me.. A &amp;quot;cheater&amp;quot;. I hate labels so God damn much... But it&amp;#39;s true. I did cheat. I have so many regrets.. Not being able to tell him because I was terrified of losing the one person I cared for most.. Having him find out by doing that.. Etc. Those people that I did that with, I cared for, but they definitely weren&amp;#39;t important to me to an enormous degree. I couldn&amp;#39;t even hardly get off sexually to it due to my medications. It was like a huge pathetic ego boost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really know why I&amp;#39;m saying all this, but I need to ask.. Am I a bad person? Because dear God, do I feel like one. How do I stop seeking validation in such n stupid ways?? Or at all really.. I feel pathetic, gross, disgusting, and like a massive whore. I had stopped, mind you, before he even found this out...

In this blog post, we'll discuss the steps you can take to train your mind to think like a millionaire. We'll explore techniques such as goal setting, visualization, and positive affirmations that can help you develop a wealthy mindset. So read on to discover how you can start your journey to financial freedom today!\n\n# Set your sights high\n\nThe first step to developing a wealthy mindset is to set your sights high. Rather than thinking of what is realistic or achievable, focus on the potential of what you can achieve. Believe that you can reach the top and strive for success.\n\nVisualize yourself achieving your goals and think about how you will feel once you reach them. Imagine the lifestyle you will have and how you will use the money you make. Think about the kind of impact you can have on others and the difference you can make in your community.\n\nFocus on the positive and don't let any negative thoughts limit your ambition. Don't get discouraged if things don't go as planned - see any obstacles as an opportunity to learn and grow. Remember, the only limits are the ones you put on yourself.\n\nBy setting your sights high, you'll be more motivated to reach your goals and cultivate a millionaire mindset. Believe in yourself, take risks, and never stop pushing forward. With a little hard work and dedication, you can achieve anything!\n\n# Develop a positive mindset\n\nHaving a positive mindset is essential if you want to be successful and achieve your goals. To develop a wealthy mindset, it's important to focus on building positive habits and overcoming negative thoughts. Here are some tips for training your mind to think like a millionaire:\n\n1. Start each day with gratitude. Developing an attitude of gratitude can help you stay focused on the positive in life and keep your eyes on the prize. Make it a habit to take a few moments each morning to list three things that you're grateful for and take time to appreciate them.\n2. Set clear, achievable goals. Creating realistic goals is key to success, as it allows you to focus your attention on a specific outcome and work towards it. Write down your goals and break them into smaller, achievable steps. This will help you stay motivated and on track.\n3. Focus on solutions, not problems. Instead of dwelling on the problem, focus on possible solutions. If a certain goal seems daunting, break it down into smaller chunks so that it feels more achievable. When something doesn't go according to plan, take a step back and look for other ways to reach your desired outcome.\n4. Surround yourself with positive people. It's important to surround yourself with people who support and encourage you in your journey towards success. Find like-minded people who inspire and motivate you and make sure to spend quality time with them.\n5. Celebrate your wins, big or small. Taking the time to celebrate your wins, no matter how big or small, will give you a sense of accomplishment and make the journey to success more enjoyable.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to developing a wealthy mindset that will help you reach your goals. Remember to stay focused and take it one step at a time.\n\n# Focus on your goals\n\nWhen it comes to developing a wealthy mindset, having a goal is the most important step. Whether you want to increase your net worth, build a successful business, or simply create a better financial future for yourself, having a clearly defined goal is essential.\n\nWhen establishing a goal, it's important to be specific. Ask yourself questions like What do I want to achieve? and How much money do I want to make? Once you have answered these questions, break down your goal into smaller goals. These smaller goals should be tangible and measurable. Having clear, attainable objectives will help you stay focused and motivated.\n\nIt's also important to have an action plan in place. Create a list of tasks that will help you reach your goals, as well as timelines for when each task should be completed. Additionally, identify any obstacles you may encounter on the way to achieving your goal and come up with ways to overcome them.\n\nFinally, make sure to track your progress and review your goals regularly. Noting your successes will help you stay motivated, while acknowledging your failures will help you improve your approach and stay on track. Having an open dialogue with yourself about your progress will help you stay focused and keep you on track.\n\n# Be persistent\n\nOne of the most important aspects of developing a wealthy mindset is persistence. No matter how hard something may seem, don\u2019t give up; keep going and you will eventually succeed. When faced with an obstacle, it\u2019s easy to become overwhelmed and want to quit. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to stay persistent. Acknowledge that the task at hand is hard, but don\u2019t let that stop you from making progress.\n\nEven if you fail at first, try again and adjust your approach. With enough practice and determination, you\u2019ll be able to break through any barrier you face. Additionally, it helps to set realistic goals that are achievable within a reasonable timeframe. If you\u2019re aiming too high, you might become frustrated when you can\u2019t reach it right away. By keeping your expectations in check, you\u2019ll be more likely to achieve success.\n\nFinally, maintain a positive attitude throughout your journey. It can be difficult to stay motivated when things don\u2019t go your way, but you need to remember that failure is just a part of the process. Treat mistakes as learning opportunities and use them to become better at whatever it is you\u2019re trying to do. Keeping a strong mental attitude will help you stay focused and push forward even when the odds seem insurmountable.\n\n# Be patient\n\nWhen it comes to developing a wealthy mindset, patience is key. Oftentimes, those looking to become wealthy can become frustrated and give up too quickly when they don\u2019t see the financial success they desire immediately. The truth is, it takes time to build and maintain wealth.\n\nThe key is to have patience and remain focused on your goals. Believe in yourself and your ability to achieve them. Visualize yourself succeeding and use positive affirmations each day to help keep you motivated and remind you of what you are working towards.\n\nHaving a clear understanding of the steps needed to reach your financial goals is also important. Set yourself up for success by researching the best strategies and taking the necessary actions to make progress. Remember that small, consistent steps over time can lead to big results.\n\nTake the time to reflect on your progress each week or month and acknowledge any small successes you have had. By having patience and staying focused on your end goal, you will start to develop the right mindset for lasting financial success.\n\n# Take risks\n\nThe most successful millionaires think differently than average people, and part of this is due to their willingness to take risks. As the saying goes, no risk, no reward. For some, taking risks can be a difficult concept to grasp, but it's important to remember that the bigger the risk, the greater the potential reward.\n\nRisk-taking requires you to have confidence in your decisions, and in yourself. Before taking any risks, it's important to analyze all of the options available to you and make sure that the chances of success outweigh the potential losses. Once you've determined that the risk is worth taking, it's time to trust your instincts and go for it.\n\nTaking risks also means having faith in yourself and your ability to succeed despite potential obstacles or failure. Don't let fear of failure keep you from trying something new. Every successful person has failed at something along their journey; what sets them apart is their ability to learn from those mistakes and continue striving forward.\n\nWhen you're ready to take a risk, don't hold back - be bold and decisive. Believe in yourself and your ability to succeed, even if it doesn't work out as expected. Taking risks may seem daunting at first, but it's essential for developing a wealthy mindset. When you embrace risk-taking, you open yourself up to a world of possibilities and opportunities for success.\n\n# Stay humble\n\nWhen it comes to creating and maintaining a wealthy mindset, it\u2019s important to stay humble. A common misconception is that having a wealthy mindset means being arrogant and superior to others. In reality, having a wealthy mindset actually requires having a humble outlook.\n\nHumility allows you to focus on improving yourself and learning from those around you. It also helps you recognize the importance of hard work, perseverance, and dedication. By staying humble, you\u2019ll be more likely to stay grounded and focused on achieving your financial goals.\n\nHaving a humble attitude also allows you to stay focused on the big picture, which is essential when it comes to accumulating wealth. Being humble prevents you from getting too caught up in smaller details and keeps you from getting discouraged or overwhelmed by the process.\n\nFinally, humility will also help you build positive relationships with those who have already achieved financial success. Learning from these individuals can be incredibly valuable and will help you develop strategies that will benefit your future endeavors.\n\nBy adopting a humble attitude and seeking out mentors and guidance from successful people, you\u2019ll be able to achieve the wealthy mindset that you desire.\n\n# Give back\n\nThe power of having a wealthy mindset goes beyond the money itself. While having financial security can provide many benefits, such as the ability to pursue more leisure activities, it can also be used to give back to others.\n\nGiving back is an important part of having a wealthy mindset. When you are in a position to help others, it not only helps them but also adds meaning and purpose to your own life. It's a great way to show gratitude for your own wealth and success.\n\nThere are a variety of ways you can give back, depending on your interests and resources. You could donate money or goods to those in need, volunteer your time at a local charity, or even just reach out to someone in your community who may be struggling.\n\nBy giving back, you can make a meaningful impact on others and help create a stronger community. Not only that, but it can also have a positive effect on your own mental and emotional wellbeing. So don't forget to give back when you can \u2013 it's a key part of having a wealthy mindset.\n\n# Visualize your success\n\nDo you want to think and act like a millionaire? It\u2019s not impossible to develop a wealthy mindset, but it does take practice and discipline. One of the best ways to begin this process is by visualizing your success.\n\nVisualization is a powerful tool for training your mind to focus on achieving the goals you set for yourself. By taking time each day to visualize what success looks like, you\u2019ll create a clear image of your desired outcome in your head. As you visualize, imagine yourself taking the necessary steps to reach your goal. Picture yourself overcoming any obstacles that stand in your way and conquering any challenges that may come up.\n\nVisualizing your success will also help you stay motivated. When you envision yourself achieving your goals, it will give you the drive and determination to keep working hard and pushing forward towards them. Additionally, the more detailed your vision is, the more inspired you\u2019ll be to make it happen.\n\nTake some time today to sit down and visualize what success looks like for you.

Because of my beliefs i believe that suicide sends one strait to hell, and so i wont kill myself, at least not if all goes well. Multiple people who were close to me have died over the past few years and yet i haven't been able to cry even once over them, even though i know that in the past i would have bawled for hours and been depressed for months if something like this had occurred. I guess i still feel the emotion of longing but that's really it. Perhaps it is because everyone around me disagrees with everything i believe in, an example being my belief that being gay or saying your a man when your a woman and vice versa as unnatural. That was an example, and while i don't actively talk to everyone about these beliefs, if asked on my viewpoint i will give my honest opinion. Because of all my peers being somewhat hostile to me because of my beliefs on various topics, i have not had a friend since the age of 11, so four years now. I also tend not to talk to my peers as i view them as being far to immature, and though i may be wrong in saying so, i see myself as far more mature in comparison to them. Id say around 11 was when i noticed my emotion leaving me so maybe that's part of the reason why, though not being educated on the mind, i could not say for certain. I have heard that lack of emotion effects many aspects of your life in negative ways, stunting certain mental growth and memory, so while i don't mind feeling nothing, from what i have heard it is not a good thing to be like this. So what i would like to know is why i have become like this and perhaps how i can fix it.\n\nEdit: I forgot to add something. While i seem to feel nothing i still often act in ways that perplex myself. An example of this is how i will think, hey, i need to learn how to write for the sake of my future, as it is a area i am good at.

You are not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you feel like this in anyway, know it\u2019s people growing up, it\u2019s not you! Just change your focus within! Once you start having a lot going on, you will feel like you don\u2019t have time to hang out with friends either. Allow the friends you have to call you randomly, they miss you too. They are just tired and busy!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmbm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "wdlsgp", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ProfessionTechnical5", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfimprovement/comments/wdlsgp/dont_put_so_much_pressure_on_making_friends/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/wdlsgp/dont_put_so_much_pressure_on_making_friends/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1352066, "created_utc": 1659371494.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfimprovement", "selftext": "\nI spend my days working as a custodian\u2026 i\u2019m a loser with a horrible job\n\nI quit my job because i was done\u2026 i\u2019m scum, an unemployed NEET\n\nI stand up to my mother for harassing me\u2026 i\u2019m a terrible son\n\nI let my mother and others belittle me\u2026 i\u2019m a loser with no confidence\n\nI\u2019ve never had a girlfriend\u2026 \u201cjust put yourself out there\u201d\n\nI try to get a girlfriend\u2026 i\u2019m a \u201cCreep\u201d and an \u201cIncel\u201d\n\nI have self image and confidence issues\u2026 so not posting a picture of myself means i\u2019m \u201cfake\u201d\n\nI get over my anxiety and post a selfie\u2026 i\u2019m \u201cphotoshopped\u201d\n\n\nIt\u2019s just , whatever I do yall will make fun of me for it.

bottleneck was motivation, so I tried to become more motivated, which didn\u2019t last.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I figured I was lacking discipline, so I wanted to figure out how to become more disciplined.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But most of the \u201cadvice\u201d I found was just telling me how important discipline was and that I had to \u201cjust be more disciplined\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This really wasn\u2019t helpful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that time I learned a really important lesson about teaching:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Information itself doesn\u2019t create change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No smoker or alcoholic has ever stopped when someone gave them the information:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHey, you should quit because it\u2019s really unhealthy and will ruin your life.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What people need is transformation, not information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in order to be transformed, you\u2019ll have to understand your problems and challenges on a very deep level, breaking false beliefs along the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you then learn why the things you have tried before didn\u2019t work, and why the strategies that do work, work, you will experience an epiphany.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t feel content when you learn something new, because this is not enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aim to go deep to be transformed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Max&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null,

I have been married to my wife for about 6 years now. Together we have a 6 and a 3 year old. Recently I have been going through a bit of a mental health crisis.

One of those calls happened a few weeks which prompter me to go home and take the next few shifts off. \n\n\n   I have dealt with mental health issues before and was diagnosed with an adjusment disroder due to the a different signifcant call I attended. If it wasnt for my wife I would have never reached out for help and if Im being honest I probably wouldnt be here. The last episode I had was being losing my temper and punching a hole in the wall.

She was there every time. \n\n\n    The other day we were sitting in a parking lot and as my wife just finished getting into the car, a young gentleman came and accused her of dinging his door. I completely lost it, I told the guy \"To go fuck himself\" and speed off in the middle of a busy street. We drove home in complete silence with my 3 year old in the back seat.\n\n\n   A few days after that we driving on a nice sunny day, the subject of the previous event came up and instead of dealing with it I put the car in park, opened the door and ran off in the middle of traffic. I ran to a secluded spot and completly broke down. I sat there for some time before starting the 40 minute walk home. \n\nWhen I finally got home, I was greeted by my wife who I could tell was scared and sad. I told her how sorry I was and gave the kids a hug. Just after that my wife told me we need to talk. We walked to our bedroom and she said that because she had no idea what I was doing. She got our 6 year old to unlock my phone after I jumped out of the car. She found some text between a girl at work. I admit these texts were overly flirtatious. But sadly, thats just the tip of the iceberg. I have been overly flirtatious with numerous woman over the course of our marriage. I have had physical contact with some but never any sex. Not that it matters. \n\n\n\n     Yesterday, i gor home with my son from his cancelled swimming class to find my wife waiting for me. She quickly gave the 3 year old her phone to watch on and said we need to talk. We went to the bedroom and she closed the door.

I sat there with my head down as she told me were getting a divorce. \n\n\nShe told me I need to leave and I packed a few bags. I called my sister and told her I was coming to stay with her and my mom. Im here now.\n\n\n\nI never deserved her and I know how big of a sleaze bag I am. Thats something I know I will have to live with. I think I know deep down I was unhappy and did this as a gross way of wanting to be caught. I know someday I can be happy again but I feel like a truck hit me. I think the most fucked up thing is that I have been subconsciously preparing myself for this day . \n\nIts hard to express how badly I feel I have wronged her and completely ruined her life. And even through all that she said she still wants to do things amicably and be a present part of each others lives. \n\n\nI dont know what I wrote this in expectation of, sympathy I know I dont deserve. \n\nI went to an urgent care center and spoke to an NP aswell as a social worker.
