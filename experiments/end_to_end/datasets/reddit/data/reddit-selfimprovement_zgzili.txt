I was just kinda drifting by myself in school and it really hurt those first few years but around the 5th it became my normal and I wasn\u2019t as depressed and aggressive compared to those earlier years. I was used to just focusing on my own needs and leisurely doing whatever activities I wanted to do in the moment, though there was definitely a void in my heart that I couldn\u2019t fill, something to bring me the happiness of having a life like everyone else my age. I was so jealous seeing friend groups, especially ones with nerdy/queer/neurodivergent people, since that is what I am and it made me feel so much \u201clesser\u201d that I was so fucked up with social anxiety that I couldn\u2019t even be friends with the people i can relate to. So I filled this void with games, social media, and daydreaming about whatever my new hyperfixation was. It hurt, but I wasn\u2019t super depressed about it like before. \n\nWhile playing my favorite game I met this guy. We instantly clicked and clung to each other for months, and it was such a wonderful feeling to have someone so understanding at my side. We communicated our feelings so well, and came from such different walks of life but actually had a lot more deeper things in common. It was like Heaven for me. Reminder, this was during the pandemic and I was at home for about 7 hours after school, and he lived in the same time zone as me and was homeschooled, so we had plenty of time to spend with each other.\n\nThen, at the one year mark things started to go downhill. I had moved to the Philippines where the time zone is way different, so our AM and PM would be switched. This meant that we could only talk to each other in my mornings or nights, which wasn\u2019t that big of a deal since he was a night owl and stayed up until 4AM anyways. But then school started to really pick up and I was at a loss. See, I\u2019m the type of person that is incredibly easy to wear out. Since school in the Philippines is from 7am to 5pm, this was wildly different from what I used to experience in the U.S., with a half-virtual class schedule I was only on campus from about 9am to 4pm. This may seem like a small difference, but my body could definitely feel it. It was overwhelming at first, and I even considered moving back home, but that was not an option and just a moment of dramatic irrationality anyways. On top of this, schoolwork was speeding up with my now 8 subjects compared to the previous 4. So, I would text my only friend less often, since I had only a few precious hours to spend winding down from the draining environment, plus going out more considering my extended family is all here and in the U.S. it was just me and my parents sitting in the house doing nothing. \n\nHe catches on to this and basically tells me that our relationship just doesn\u2019t feel the same as before because my texts are infrequent, and whenever I do text it\u2019s not as deep or entertaining as our previous conversations. While this is absolutely true, it did hurt a little considering that I tried to squeeze out what little energy I have for him and he doesn\u2019t appreciate it. Also the fact that he said \u201cthe last time we did anything memorable was a month ago\u201d, which was not true for me. But I absolutely understand where he\u2019s coming from; your closest friend seems to no longer show interest in you or bothers to make time in their day for you. That feels bad but it also feels bad on my end being blamed for things out of my control, you know?\n\nToday I was very sleepy the whole day, like I usually am, and we start engaging in very shallow conversation. He then says \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting to get this far today now that you don\u2019t talk to me anymore\u201d and idk I just felt kinda villainized. And then he starts telling me about his new online friend that he\u2019s starting to click with, and I\u2019m slightly jealous but mostly happy for him, that he can get his needs while I can distance myself and live the way I want to. Still, it hurts because it feels like he\u2019s replacing me, telling me that his new friend is into the same things he is (things that I can\u2019t really relate to). I couldn\u2019t help but just leave the conversation after that gushing, and that\u2019s what brings me to what I\u2019m doing right now. \n\nI\u2019ve had some time to let my sadness calm and I don\u2019t want to make him out to be an asshole because that\u2019s not what he is, but sometimes I just feel like he\u2019s too harsh on me. But at the same time I feel like I\u2019m victimizing myself when the truth is that I just don\u2019t want to be friends anymore and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been slow on communicating. Nowadays it hurts too much to talk to him because I feel like he resents me for not having the time or energy, and on top of that he has a new candidate for a better friendship. I\u2019m the type of person that gives up very easily, so I\u2019m honestly just considering cutting ties completely to spare myself of this obligation to text all the time while also getting demonized. I want to be free, but at the same time I need someone to confide in since I don\u2019t have a friend irl. And he told me one of the big reasons why he\u2019s still with me is because he would feel bad for leaving me all alone, like I used to be before he came along. I really admire him for his empathy but now it hurts too much to talk to him knowing he doesn\u2019t really like me (from what I see). \n\nYesterday he told me that he doesn\u2019t understand why I want a friend (at school) so bad if I don\u2019t even want to maintain a relationship with them, and that society has told me that I need a friend when in reality I don\u2019t really want one and should disregard what society tells me to do. This actually made a lot of sense to me and in a way was relieving, but also distressing. Am I really just destined to be on my own because of the way I was born ? Will I ever find the happiness that other people take for granted ? Despite the shock, I really do feel like I identify with what he said. \n\nHonestly I don\u2019t think anybody is gonna read this, I mostly just need to get this off my chest and collect my thoughts. I guess my intent with this post is to ask: how can I do better? Is there such thing as a person who can be happy without a companion? Am I too lazy ? Nowadays my classmates are way friendlier and I have more family members to have fun with, so I\u2019m not completely isolated like I was during my depression. Should I end our relationship altogether from simply how awkward it\u2019s become? Or should I just let him be a \u201ctalking buddy\u201d every once in a while ?

But at the same time I feel like I\u2019m victimizing myself when the truth is that I just don\u2019t want to be friends anymore and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been slow on communicating. Nowadays it hurts too much to talk to him because I feel like he resents me for not having the time or energy, and on top of that he has a new candidate for a better friendship. I\u2019m the type of person that gives up very easily, so I\u2019m honestly just considering cutting ties completely to spare myself of this obligation to text all the time while also getting demonized. I want to be free, but at the same time I need someone to confide in since I don\u2019t have a friend irl. And he told me one of the big reasons why he\u2019s still with me is because he would feel bad for leaving me all alone, like I used to be before he came along. I really admire him for his empathy but now it hurts too much to talk to him knowing he doesn\u2019t really like me (from what I see). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday he told me that he doesn\u2019t understand why I want a friend (at school) so bad if I don\u2019t even want to maintain a relationship with them, and that society has told me that I need a friend when in reality I don\u2019t really want one and should disregard what society tells me to do. This actually made a lot of sense to me and in a way was relieving, but also distressing. Am I really just destined to be on my own because of the way I was born ? Will I ever find the happiness that other people take for granted ? Despite the shock, I really do feel like I identify with what he said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly I don\u2019t think anybody is gonna read this, I mostly just need to get this off my chest and collect my thoughts. I guess my intent with this post is to ask: how can I do better? Is there such thing as a person who can be happy without a companion? Am I too lazy ? Nowadays my classmates are way friendlier and I have more family members to have fun with, so I\u2019m not completely isolated like I was during my depression. Should I end our relationship altogether from simply how awkward it\u2019s become? Or should I just let him be a \u201ctalking buddy\u201d every once in a while ? I don\u2019t know what to do anymore\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false,

What if she didn't reach out to me at all (very scary to think about that), I like her SO MUCH as a friend, as a person. I don't think I can find anyone like her.

According to Webster\u2019s dictionary, it means to perceive through sight or apprehension. So, you can see something as it is, through sight, or through the eyes of fear, apprehension. Isn\u2019t this interesting?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoesn\u2019t this make you think that how you perceive something affects how you react to it? If you look at something and behold it as it is, you\u2019ll respond appropriately.  But if you allow the ego to see it from a fearful perspective, then you\u2019ll react differently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe word behold isn\u2019t used very often.  It was very popular in Christian writings concerning where you placed your focus, specifically your attention, was to be on God, not on the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour attempts to keep up in the fast-paced environment around you may leave you with a true lack of presence, both with others and yourself. The ego entices you to live in a utopian future, in the past, or in a technologically enhanced version of the present that promises to provide you with greater happiness. Your recollections, aspirations, and desires aren\u2019t counterbalanced by a sobering realization of where you are right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot being fully present interferes with how you go about living your daily life because it shows up in your home, social circle, spiritual life, etc. Being fully present with someone helps you to slow down, pay attention, and truly accept that person's joys and sorrows as your own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;We become what we behold. We shape our tools and then our tools shape us. \\~ Marshall McLuhan\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What Are You Beholding?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis, again, is a question of perception and where you are placing your focus.  Are you always beholding the negative and, therefore, you see more undesirable things? Understand that what you focus upon becomes your reality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery day, you encounter situations you may either choose to ignore or choose to concentrate on and ultimately become. When you concentrate on the unpleasant aspects of the relationship, you may become resentful. It may be a condition where you become ill by concentrating on the discomfort you feel. It can be a debt that has accumulated because it diverts your attention from paying bills, which makes you feel less abundant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat you behold, you become. You develop into what you concentrate on, what you watch, listen to, and associate with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was trying to forgive my mother for the trauma she caused me, I was asking Spirit why I was struggling.  What I discovered didn\u2019t surprise me.  I was beholding the anger I felt, so I became angry.  I was focusing on what she did and how I felt instead of focusing on my healing, which included forgiving her. When I beheld compassion for what she had gone through in her life, then I could feel empathy for her and forgive the pain she caused.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I slept and dreamt that life was joy. I awoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold, service was joy. \\~ Rabindranath Tagore\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What Aren\u2019t You Seeing Anymore?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've all seen pennies. If I asked you to describe a penny for me, you could mention its value or color, but what if I asked you to identify the person whose likeness is on the coin? What is the message on the penny to the left of the person's picture? What does the penny's reverse display? Why does that matter? You cease observing because things are so familiar that you assume you know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou stop looking sometimes because you believe you have found something worth more or is more important to you now. Sometimes, when you are strolling through a parking lot, you may notice a coin on the ground and choose to ignore it, since it has no significance to you. Sometimes you quit beholding because you just have no need or don\u2019t care about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut what if what you see or who you see\u2014can satisfy all of your needs, wants, and questions? What if the ego plans to keep you preoccupied and blinded so you never see the magic of what is?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe actions required for you to behold something or someone take time to do because it requires you to fully be present and take in the completeness and comprehend what is being observed. Again, it\u2019s about questioning where you are focusing your time and energy. What consumes your thoughts? Where are you spending your time? Are you being a good steward of what\u2019s placed in your care?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;To behold, you must first believe. \\~ Lailah Gifty Akita\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Be Honest With Yourself\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are being completely honest with yourself, you get distracted by a variety of things, including your job, friends, family, ambitious projects, mindless scrolling of social media, and too much screen time. Your daily life moves so quickly. It has been common practice to view \"busyness\" as a triumph and a success indicator.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've discovered that you miss your soulful self speaking to you because you are so consumed with your activities. See, the bustle of life muffles Spirit\u2019s message. In the periods when you are with your family, when it\u2019s calm in the morning, and when things are difficult. You miss your authentic self in it all because you are so preoccupied with the daily activities that you cannot stop and behold the things that Spirit has arranged for you and the synchronicities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you behold every day? What captures your attention on a typical day? You have a lot to consider in this life. Now you can look into the lives of thousands of people with just one click thanks to social media. You can receive breaking news directly on your mobile device. If you consume enough of it, you frequently end up with a heavy heart and an uneasy mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;We become like that which we behold. We will never be transformed until we learn how to behold. \\~ Sam Storms\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Beholding With A New Perspective\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I understand you might wonder how this might unfold on a typical day. In an effort to keep your eyes fixed on the positive, are you to disregard the injustices you witness or the issues that develop in your life? No, is the response to these inquiries. Your fixation on those things that are wholesome does not prevent you from observing other things. Simply said, it implies that you view everything else in the light of Spirit and how it aligns with your authentic self.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy husband will always be in my thoughts, but when I'm not focused on the truth, I see him through my life experiences. But when I see my husband through Spirit's eyes, it\u2019s a much broader viewpoint. It enables me to view things as they actually are and as they ought to be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlong the healing journey, you have averted your gaze to the negative aspects of your life. But you don\u2019t want to continue to behold those areas because you don\u2019t want them to become and stay your reality.  Allowing the ego to control where you focus means you remain in fear and hopelessness. Instead, you want to focus on what you desire your life to be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;My heart is singing for joy this morning! A miracle has happened! The light of understanding has shone upon my little pupil's mind, and behold, all things are changed! \\~ Anne Sullivan\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Moving Forward Beholding\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLiving gracefully means you ground yourself each day.  It means you are humble and understand everyone is equal to you, which is seen in the way you cherish your connections with others. And you make these authentic connections by being gentle with yourself and others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut beholding encompasses the ability to see with the lens of love what is. It shows your ability to look past the egoic mind\u2019s ability to cloud your sight with fear. See the wonder of each person, their uniqueness, their strengths, and their weakness, and yet still honor their authentic being by seeing them with love.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen the Bible discusses beholding Christ or keeping your focus on God, the lesson is about being fully present and truly seeing what is so you can emulate those positive characteristics. Because what you focus on, you become.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what do you want to become?  If you don\u2019t want your past to continue, then you need to stop beholding the past. Focusing on what you lack will create more lack. But if you behold your goals and dreams and focus on moving towards those things you desire, what will happen? What you behold is what you become, so your dreams will become your reality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Behold God beholding you... and smiling. \\~ Anthony de Mello", "author_fullname": "t2_kfticokc", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Behold, It's Meaning And Importance In Living An Authentic Life", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/selfimprovement", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_z7qhur", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tips and Tricks", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1669718446.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.selfimprovement", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you know what it means to behold? According to Webster\u2019s dictionary, it means to perceive through sight or apprehension. So, you can see something as it is, through sight, or through the eyes of fear, apprehension. Isn\u2019t this interesting?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doesn\u2019t this make you think that how you perceive something affects how you react to it? If you look at something and behold it as it is, you\u2019ll respond appropriately.  But if you allow the ego to see it from a fearful perspective, then you\u2019ll react differently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The word behold isn\u2019t used very often.  It was very popular in Christian writings concerning where you placed your focus, specifically your attention, was to be on God, not on the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your attempts to keep up in the fast-paced environment around you may leave you with a true lack of presence, both with others and yourself. The ego entices you to live in a utopian future, in the past, or in a technologically enhanced version of the present that promises to provide you with greater happiness. Your recollections, aspirations, and desires aren\u2019t counterbalanced by a sobering realization of where you are right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not being fully present interferes with how you go about living your daily life because it shows up in your home, social circle, spiritual life, etc. Being fully present with someone helps you to slow down, pay attention, and truly accept that person&amp;#39;s joys and sorrows as your own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We become what we behold. We shape our tools and then our tools shape us. ~ Marshall McLuhan&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What Are You Beholding?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This, again, is a question of perception and where you are placing your focus.  Are you always beholding the negative and, therefore, you see more undesirable things? Understand that what you focus upon becomes your reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every day, you encounter situations you may either choose to ignore or choose to concentrate on and ultimately become. When you concentrate on the unpleasant aspects of the relationship, you may become resentful. It may be a condition where you become ill by concentrating on the discomfort you feel. It can be a debt that has accumulated because it diverts your attention from paying bills, which makes you feel less abundant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What you behold, you become.

I\u2019m 60 lbs lighter, I\u2019m muscular, I\u2019m confident, I\u2019m smooth, I pull girls, I can do everything and more that I could never dream of earlier in life, my quality of life has greatly improved, I\u2019ve gotten on nofap and that\u2019s greatly improved my life as well, I\u2019m on a constant spiral up and I don\u2019t intend to stop. I have hit a bump tho, as can be inferred I could never attract women before now, but now I\u2019ve got girls coming to me, there\u2019s one that I\u2019m talking to right now that I can\u2019t quite figure out. She\u2019s very sweet and beautiful but she\u2019s got some qualities that I\u2019m not wild about, and I\u2019m constantly bouncing between going after her and labeling her low value and moving on to find a better girl, but I\u2019m just confused at one point I\u2019m fantasizing in my head about dating her then the next I consider her low qualities and want to move on.\nSo my questions are&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Should I date this girl despite her low qualities or should I move on from her for a higher quality girl.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She\u2019s mentioned sex, I\u2019ve considered it almost as a symbol of victory, going from being a fat loser to being a successful man who can fuck a girl whenever he wants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Should I as a rapidly improving man, sleep with a lower value girl or is that wrong?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "298cd47c-1e96-11ed-bd72-fe7bc3f1a69c", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmbm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#94e044", "id": "z4hqun", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Fun-Jicama1938", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfimprovement/comments/z4hqun/im_stuck_and_need_help/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/z4hqun/im_stuck_and_need_help/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1352066, "created_utc": 1669394259.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfimprovement", "selftext": "I went to sit down on the toilet, but ended up hitting the rim instead.

social behaviors that were recently highlighted after a woman I was talking to \\[22F\\] decided that it would be best to cut all communication during the talking stage. We'd been in contact for 2 months.\n\nI apologize if this post is everywhere. There are too many details to think about and I have always been bad at summarizing stories to their key elements.\n\n**Context on where I am coming from**\n\n* I haven't been socialized well all my life. I was pretty lonely and awkward as a child and ended being in a period where, throughout high school, I ended being mostly alone with no real close relationships. This feeling of loneliness hasn't really changed, as I don't really have close friends even now.\n* I am suspected of having Asperger's syndrome and have been diagnosed with depression and inattentive ADHD.\n* I struggle with mental health problems, social anxiety and low self esteem, all of which make it hard for me to be in social relationships.\n* This was the closest to a romantic relationship I've experienced and sadly, the most intimate relationship I've had.\n\nI say all this not to excuse any of my behaviors but rather to provide an idea of how I operate, and a better roadmap to hopefully get out of these horrible behaviors. This is something I want to grow out of, as I no longer want to hurt anyone or myself.\n\nI want to break out of the cycle that has been depriving me of a good relationship all my life and not repeat the same mistakes ever again.\n\n**Timeline of Relationship**\n\n* We meet on tinder \\[I was running a joke account. Important note is that I didn't show my face\\] and connected because she went along with the bit. After a week of communicating, I decide to link her my discord account so we can continue our chats and hopefully become friends.\n* We end up hitting it off. She says she is attracted to me and I reject her because  \n\n   * I did not feel ready for a relationship, knowing that I had trouble connecting with other people before\n   * I felt like my life was a mess\n   * I felt too ugly and unfit to be in a relationship\n* However, I did secretly have feelings for her and held onto those for a few weeks before spilling the beans.\n* This heads a tumultuous few weeks where I was head over heels for her, practically having chats with her every night and kind of rushing the relationship in the process due to my own ineptitude. Keep in mind that while this was happening, I was still too scared to really reveal much information about myself, which would be a point of contention. We talked nearly every night.\n* I made the big mistake of not being aware of my feelings in the moment and did say 'I love you'. A point of contention was that I could not truly explain what love was to me.\n\n**Inciting Incident For Break Up**\n\n* I had revealed my face to her after she had asked for it  \n\n   * Note: I had suggested to show my face early on but she declined it in order to respect my boundaries, stating that I should not do it out of feelings of obligation but rather on my own time.\n* After stressing about it, I had suggested that we should meet each other in person.\n* A few days later, I offer to turn my face cam on as she had it on from a previous chat she had with friends.\n* During this chat, I make several mistakes  \n\n   * First, I was acting in a kind of erratic way in front of a camera. I don't know how to explain it, but whenever I am on camera I can't help but do silly things like shove objects into it or display things on my desk.\n   * When she told me to knock it off I had assumed that she had meant it playfully, so I responded by saying 'Listen here motherfucker' in a way that was meant to be taken as exaggeration. She takes this as insulting \\[as she didn't have that sort of rapport\\] and I stop.\n   * After this, I sort of just blank out as a lot was on my mind at the moment \\[on that day I had gotten diagnosed with ADHD, among other things\\]. What I had not known was that I was blanked out during a video call, making it look like I was staring at her.  \n\n      * It does not help that I did literally make a joke at the end of the call, stating 'well, I don't really have much to say anymore so I guess I'll just stare at you now'.\n* A few days later, I ask her if I did anything to make her uncomfortable or irritated. She tells me that I had made her uncomfortable and lists many of her grievances that she had during the relationship.\n\n**Problems During The Relationship**\n\n* **Stonewalling**  \n\n   * I have this strange habit of not being able to answer/provide for very basic questions about myself, whether it be due to my mind going blank and freezing once asked or being just too secretive in a paranoid way.  \n\n      * To know how bad this was, I was afraid of sending her an example of my handwriting because I felt it was messy.\n      * I did also hide some basic information about myself such as photos of myself because in my head, I was felt too justified to hide myself. I guess I was scared of her seeing the real me despite desiring intimacy.\n* **Accidental Triggering**  \n\n   * \\[22F\\] was a victim of sexual assault and had trauma associated with it. I knew about this fairly early on in the relationship.  \n\n      * During a period of our relationship, when we were calling until we both asleep, we'd talk about fantasies of what we'd do if we were sleeping together in real life. Many of the things I said \\[cuddling,kissing\\] would have turned out to be triggers for her trauma. One infamous line that made her realize these triggers was something to the effect of \"once I get my hands on you, I'll cuddle with you and ever let you go\". That line was meant to be playful but is something I regretted immensely once she told me that it had triggered her.\n* I was rushing the relationship  \n\n   * This was my first 'romantic' experience period, so I really didn't know what we were doing.  \n\n      * A key moment was soon after we had expressed attraction for eachother, I had accidentally called her my girlfriend when we were not at that point\n   * I had frequently made jokes about us being a couple, which I assumed had been fine because she had put up with them until the break up\n   * The idea of a relationship was something I got lost in and yet dreaded. I did not feel like I was really ready for a relationship and yet it blinded me to the point where it was all I desired. Hard to explain.\n   * There was confusion of what our label was. We went from friends with the potential for romance to situationship to talking phase.\n\nQuestion: \\[do not limit advice to just these questions. If you have other comments pelase let me know.

A point of contention was that I could not truly explain what love was to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inciting Incident For Break Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had revealed my face to her after she had asked for it  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Note: I had suggested to show my face early on but she declined it in order to respect my boundaries, stating that I should not do it out of feelings of obligation but rather on my own time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After stressing about it, I had suggested that we should meet each other in person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days later, I offer to turn my face cam on as she had it on from a previous chat she had with friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this chat, I make several mistakes  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;First, I was acting in a kind of erratic way in front of a camera. I don&amp;#39;t know how to explain it, but whenever I am on camera I can&amp;#39;t help but do silly things like shove objects into it or display things on my desk.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When she told me to knock it off I had assumed that she had meant it playfully, so I responded by saying &amp;#39;Listen here motherfucker&amp;#39; in a way that was meant to be taken as exaggeration. She takes this as insulting [as she didn&amp;#39;t have that sort of rapport] and I stop.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;After this, I sort of just blank out as a lot was on my mind at the moment [on that day I had gotten diagnosed with ADHD, among other things]. What I had not known was that I was blanked out during a video call, making it look like I was staring at her.&lt;br/&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It does not help that I did literally make a joke at the end of the call, stating &amp;#39;well, I don&amp;#39;t really have much to say anymore so I guess I&amp;#39;ll just stare at you now&amp;#39;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days later, I ask her if I did anything to make her uncomfortable or irritated. She tells me that I had made her uncomfortable and lists many of her grievances that she had during the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problems During The Relationship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stonewalling&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I have this strange habit of not being able to answer/provide for very basic questions about myself, whether it be due to my mind going blank and freezing once asked or being just too secretive in a paranoid way.&lt;br/&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;To know how bad this was, I was afraid of sending her an example of my handwriting because I felt it was messy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I did also hide some basic information about myself such as photos of myself because in my head, I was felt too justified to hide myself. I guess I was scared of her seeing the real me despite desiring intimacy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accidental Triggering&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[22F] was a victim of sexual assault and had trauma associated with it. I knew about this fairly early on in the relationship.&lt;br/&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;During a period of our relationship, when we were calling until we both asleep, we&amp;#39;d talk about fantasies of what we&amp;#39;d do if we were sleeping together in real life. Many of the things I said [cuddling,kissing] would have turned out to be triggers for her trauma. One infamous line that made her realize these triggers was something to the effect of &amp;quot;once I get my hands on you, I&amp;#39;ll cuddle with you and ever let you go&amp;quot;. That line was meant to be playful but is something I regretted immensely once she told me that it had triggered her.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was rushing the relationship  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This was my first &amp;#39;romantic&amp;#39; experience period, so I really didn&amp;#39;t know what we were doing.&lt;br/&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A key moment was soon after we had expressed attraction for eachother, I had accidentally called her my girlfriend when we were not at that point&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I had frequently made jokes about us being a couple, which I assumed had been fine because she had put up with them until the break up&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The idea of a relationship was something I got lost in and yet dreaded. I did not feel like I was really ready for a relationship and yet it blinded me to the point where it was all I desired. Hard to explain.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There was confusion of what our label was. We went from friends with the potential for romance to situationship to talking phase.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Question: [do not limit advice to just these questions. If you have other comments pelase let me know. I am desperate to never do any of this again and change as a person]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How do I be more socially conscious of other people&amp;#39;s feelings and not be so absorbed by my own feelings?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How do I become more vulnerable and not hide myself from those I desire to be close with?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How do I recognize and temper my own feelings in a relationship?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How do I tone down my own quirks and behaviors?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR - A serious of unfortunate events and mistakes that only a socially inept person can make ends in break up, and now he&amp;#39;s seeking advice on how to change himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc":

time. my friends wake up at 6am to study more and meanwhile I finished watching Shameless ( which is 132 hours, mind you) in 2 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please tell me what to do, that&amp;#39;s all I ask, just tell me what to do because I it seems like I cannot take my life in my own hands. even now, instead of preparing for my exam, I am writing this and planning to eat...v&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false,
