Sold my vehicle and stole thousands of dollars worth of tools.\nGot out right before Xmas 2019\nMother refused to let me come home until March 2020\nThat gf broke up with me and chose heroin over me after getting out due to COVID in March 2020.\nI am on probation until 2025\nI haven&amp;#39;t been able to drive since July 15 2019 when I was thrown in jail.\nI was alone and jobless, depressed about the pandemic from March 2020 until Sept 2020 when I met another girl at a party.\nTold her I had no phone, no license, she gave me her email and number anyway.\nNeighbor gave me a job the next day.\nShe picked me up a week later and went out.\nLiterally had more in common with her than anyone I have ever met.\nWe fell in love so hard it was crazy. I couldn&amp;#39;t believe how lucky I was and she was cool with me living at home with no license.\nTold her about my past early on. She had traumatic experiences with her older brother who was a drug addict.\nI&amp;#39;m happy for the first time in YEARS with her.\nFigure out that she takes a lot of mail-order Xanax and has an adderall prescription for her MS.\nWe smoke weed, drink together, take LSD sometimes. She gives me Xanax sometimes.\nShe found out that I tried to buy some coke from my buddy because my boss wanted some. He screenshotted that text and sent it to her for NO REASON.\nNever mentioned it to me.\nShe starts acting very paranoid.\nLoses her job working from home because it seems like she&amp;#39;s scared to answer the phone.\nAccuses me one night of smearing invisible drugs on the wall and absorbing them through my skin. Lots of other weird stuff too.\nConstantly accuses me of doing heroin/meth/cocaine.\nShe goes through all the stuff in my workshop, finds 3 needles I forgot about a long time ago. Doesn&amp;#39;t say anything.\nAccuses me of putting drugs on the fridge door handle, and other crazy shit involving drugs that make no sense.\nI buy a drug test and take it right in front of her and pass everything except for weed. She calmed down a bit.\n2 days later my friend comes over for a beer after she left. He gives me 3 Xanax.\nShe finds out he came over and flips out on me.\nGhosts me for a week.\nTexts me and accuses me of putting drugs in her lotion and her vape. Says I cheated on the urine test I took somehow.\nBreaks up with me.\nI try like hell to get her back for 2 months.\nShe comes back and tells me she thought I was breaking into her apartment and putting drugs in her wall and she spent hours chipping paint off her wall. Don&amp;#39;t know what to say except that I would never do anything like that even if I was secretly on drugs and nobody else ever would.\nTalking with her best friend constantly who also thinks shes losing it.\nI realize she&amp;#39;s really losing her mind.\nFor a week she&amp;#39;s scared to come back in the house so we go out on dates and have sex in her car instead.\nThings calm down I slowly convince her to come back inside and we&amp;#39;re back together.\nShe admits she has a Xanax problem and we start going to NA meetings together for both of us.\nOne night we get back from an NA meeting and dinner together and she goes to the bathroom.\nComes out crying saying she can&amp;#39;t stay over tonight because I&amp;#39;m re-grouting the tiles on the bathroom floor in front of the toilet and mixing drugs in the grout.\nThe floor was wet from condensation making the grout in front of the toilet look darker.\nHave a huge talk about all of this. She said I&amp;#39;m trying to get her hooked on heroin.\nDeny everything because it&amp;#39;s obviously not true and try to explain things using logic. \nShe says that because I used to be an addict I&amp;#39;m always going to want to do it again.\nFinally calm her down and we go to bed.\nNext morning I leave to go to work.\nWalk down the street to my boss&amp;#39;s house and wait for him for an hour. He&amp;#39;s taking forever.\nWonder why she hasn&amp;#39;t left my house yet.\nGo back home and open the door and surprise her.\nI walk into the bathroom and see that she&amp;#39;s been squeezing out my toothpaste into the sink, also some of my shaving cream and cologne.\nWe go outside, talk like nothing happened, and she leaves.\nLater I come back home after work and find that she was peeling some of the paint off my wall.\nShe comes back a few days later for her birthday and we had a good time, nothing weird happened.\nWeek later she ghosts me out of nowhere.\nHeartbroken as hell again. After a few days of texting her my friend gives me some Xanax.\nI take a Xanax bar to try to calm down and drink some beers, pass out on the basement floor.\nMy other friend drops by and calls an ambulance.\nThe ambulance shows up and my mom asks me if I&amp;#39;m trying to kill myself. Don&amp;#39;t remember any of this.\nI say if I wanted to die I&amp;#39;d already be dead.\nThat&amp;#39;s all the paramedics needed to hear.\nThey take me to the hospital and lock me in a room for 2 days.\nThen they take my phone away and take me to a psych ward.\nI feel so heartbroken and depressed I wanna die but I hold it together and act like I&amp;#39;m ok.\nAfter 10 days the psych Dr. diagnosed me with depression and clears me to leave.\nMy mother&amp;#39;s house is my address, so they call her and tell her.\nShe tells them to keep me there because she&amp;#39;s pissed that I did Xanax. Tells them to put me straight in a rehab.\nI realize I&amp;#39;m fucked and my mother&amp;#39;s abandoning me too and start thinking about killing myself as soon as I get out.\nAfter 2 months locked in the psych ward she finally agrees to let me come home.\nMom picks me up.\nGet my phone back, try to get in touch with my gf that I&amp;#39;m literally dying over.\nNo answer.\nI lay down in bed for 2 weeks.\nBoss finally lets me come back to work.\nI get in touch with ex&amp;#39;s best friend (lets call her ann and call my ex sarah)\nAnn says Sarah ghosted her too a week after I got hospitalized because she found out that she did coke with her ex bf a few times.\nAnn gets in touch with Sarah&amp;#39;s daughter and her daughter says her mom is very sick.\nSays Sarah is destroying the furniture and stuff in their apartment looking for drugs that I planted there, even cutting pillows open.\nSays if we try to go over there to see her mom she&amp;#39;ll call the cops.\nI am devastated.\nAnn keeps trying to get in touch with my ex Sarah through her daughter.\nDaughter says she&amp;#39;s crazy and she thinks it&amp;#39;s all really happening and she&amp;#39;s moving out and removing herself from the situation.\nI start texting her and writing long emails and letters pouring my heart out to her.\nNo answer for over 7 months since the breakup.\nI am in hell everyday, overthinking, heartbroken hell to the point where I have dreams about it. I drove her crazy by being an idiot.\nWorst breakup of my life and I STILL can&amp;#39;t drive yet.\nProbation found out I was in the psych ward and they are making me jump through 1000 extra hoops.\nI will never have another gf that I have that much in common with and she hates me and thinks I want to poison her.\nI see no future other than working like a blue-collar slave until I die in a world where I can&amp;#39;t trust anyone anymore, not even my own mother, and society is going to shit.\nThe love of my life is gone forever and it&amp;#39;s all MY FAULT for being a scumbag drug user.\nAMA&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "tn6rlb", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ScottyDangerously", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/tn6rlb/my_ex_gf_accused_me_of_trying_to_drug_her_and/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tn6rlb/my_ex_gf_accused_me_of_trying_to_drug_her_and/", "subreddit_subscribers": 927661, "created_utc": 1648159362.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext": "my parents hates me, and i have a difficult situation.

I thought he was loyal\u2026 he talked marriage he talked family. The kids were already calling me mom after month three while I thought we were good. Four months in he got me pregnant. With my consent. But he asked me to get breed in the middle of sex. And it worked. Not long after I found the apps. Than I found it again. And again. I thought we had great sex although I wished always it was more about me and not just when I touch his butthole he goes limb with his hands behind his back like okay.

back home and he marked me zero. this is not the first time, it happens a lot with me. when my mom asks me to go out and buy something, i forget what i have to buy when i reach the store. i always feel worthless. even though im decent and i would say above average in coding skills but still my learning curve is very bad. i started learning to code at the age of 13. now im 18 and im just slightly better than my classmates and im sure they will soon be better than me because my retarded brain learns very slowly. i always had a hard time in learning books for exams also.. even after 4 years of coding experience, i can hardly solve a B or C level (max is E or F or G or H) question on codeforces (programmers can relate). and my friends who started learning coding few months back can are almost on same level as me. i feel so useless to be honest. whenever i get a question which requires a lot of brain use, i feel very overwhelming and confused. and the same thing when i do in a group, i feel completely lost. i cant sleep at night, i sleep properly only when im very tired. otherwise i only feel sleepy during day time. and also, i always feel very tiring and low on energy. i feel shit when people come and talk to me because my energy is so low and negative, i dont want them to know that im this bad. thats why i stay away from people. i dont feel hungry. i can go for days without eating. my parents force me to eat. i feel very empty and braindead all day. i feel like my brain is empty and im fucking stupid piece of shit. the only good thing is that i never feel
