commute is nearly an hour and a half  \n \\&gt;move further north into my own room away from Chris so commute isn't as brutal but we still hang out over the weekends to play League of legends  \n \\&gt;friendship with Chris had seemed pretty one sided the entire time but I had not been aware of it at the time  \n \\&gt;I had done plenty of favors for Chris thinking he was my best friend, such as bringing him to cheap restaurants and covering his tab since he was unemployed for some time and giving him rides from his work once he did find a job  \n \\&gt;Chris however flat out refused to ever take the metro to my new place over the weekends, so it was always me who drove south to pick him up, drive him up north to my place, we'd play League and get a bite to eat usually, then I'd drive him back down south before driving back to my room  \n \\&gt;I manage to hold onto current job meanwhile, even though it isn't easy  \n \\&gt;the commute is killing me, and my overall self esteem is non existent thinking back to ex gf's social media post as well as the fact I paid $160k for an engineering degree but was struggling so much to hold down any job that paid more than $20 or $22 an hour  \n \\&gt;one day, while we're playing League at my place up north, I alt-tab to quickly look through some boards on 4chan I have open\n\n\\&gt;Chris happens to be really far left leaning and always was getting into political arguments on reddit  \n \\&gt;sees a thread asking for racist jokes and asks what kind of racist, hateful website this  \n \\&gt;I explain it's just how the culture on 4chan is, there\u2019s plenty of ironically racist, sexist or off color content but I just go on it occasionally for memes and funny takes on the news among other boards  \n \\&gt;Chris' behavior changes with me changes immediately after this  \n \\&gt;when I head upstairs to make a phonecall to parents, I hear banging coming from downstairs living room  \n \\&gt;come back down and see Chris is banging mouse on table whenever he's losing while playing League, tell him to take it easy but bangs it one or two more times  \n \\&gt;my turn to play, he calls me an idiot when I lose, I snap at him looking clearly angry and he reluctantly apologizes and I drive him back home  \n \\&gt;tell parents later about what happened, they urge me he was probably stressed from his new job and I should reconcile with him  \n \\&gt;I do so over text, he expresses he's glad I forgave him, and Chris and I hang out as usual over the next month\n\n\\&gt;final day arrives at that one last job with the long commute  \n \\&gt;I just happen to be so homesick, depressed, stressed and still slightly hurt from that break up  \n \\&gt;talk with my boss and ask him to cut the contract, I just want to return home, tears were actually streaming down my face unexpectedly, I just had that much pent up depression and insecurity building up in me  \n \\&gt;I return back to my place and pack my stuff to go home and text Chris that I quit the job and am returning home, ask if he wants to hang out one last short time and he agrees  \n \\&gt;as soon as I arrive at his place, he immediately starts horsing around with me once I step inside like he's one of the street fighter characters he liked to play  \n \\&gt;We play a couple of last rounds of League before I leave, he asks if I'm stupid when I ask him a question about what item to get  \n \\&gt;one last thing he did that really bugged me before I left, he placed his hand on my shoulder and gave me this blank look for a few seconds. He did that 2 or three times before in the friendship, I thought he was just being friendly but in retrospect I feel like such a complete chump for letting him do such condescending thing to me  \n \\&gt;after I return home, I just haven't felt quite the same for the last three years (I returned home in 2019 and was 29, now I'm 32)  \n \\&gt;feel simultaneously incredibly low iq, spineless, beta, hopeless  \n \\&gt;on top of all this, I can't believe I allowed someone who I thought was my best friend to almost abuse or bully me while I was already suicidally depressed in that big city (this I had confided in with him)  \n \\&gt;self esteem just hasn't returned to normal, I think I'm too dumb and/or autistic to actually work an engineering job despite spending that much money on my degree  \n \\&gt;don't even feel like ever approaching women any more  \n \\&gt;feeling pretty broken constantly and betrayed  \n \\&gt;typing all of this out really helps me recover though  \n Feel

I usually try to block that by listening to music but the feeling is still there, I\u2019m still dreading the journey and still get really anxious whenever I go out shopping, I\u2019m always terrified now I will bump into (one of) them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what to do so I won\u2019t feel all this anxiety and fear and constant worry. I don\u2019t want to confront them, why should I confront some middle aged women who should know better than bullying a 20 year old just because they\u2019re unhappy! I also don\u2019t want to go to another bus stop because I still wouldn\u2019t get rid of them, they\u2019d still be on the bus. I am scared, anxious, annoyed some strangers have so much power to do this to another stranger. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to any opinion or advice!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sw9l", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "w7hy0e", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ClaryFrey8", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 7, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/bullying/comments/w7hy0e/strangers_bullying_me/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/w7hy0e/strangers_bullying_me/", "subreddit_subscribers": 7766, "created_utc": 1658732279.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "bullying", "selftext": "My stepdad continually insults, shames and challenges me in subtle and condescending ways.

I'm liberal and I would call Herman (obviously not his real name) an opportunistic and prejudiced libertarian who could be an unrepentant bully at times. We're both guys and now both pushing thirty, and we aren't in contact at all, which I'll get to - trigger warnings about self-harm towards the end.\n\nHerman was always to a degree into conspiracy theories, get-rich-quick schemes, fad diets and the like - things that elicit emotionally-driven responses that tend to be reinforced by circular reasoning patterns. He was quite a confident person and positioned himself as a wise and intelligent person, although most people who met him tended not to take his proselytising particularly seriously. He didn't read the news, tended to distrust expertise and got his information from podcasts and youtubers. It always seemed that Herman couldn't discern the more credible information from less credible stuff. By his mid 20s he had a few friends who were mostly considerably younger than him who were also into that sort of contrarianism, and their presence enabled his conspiracy rabbit holes.\n\nHerman also became a sleazebag as he got older. I met him after high school but understand that he was a bullied outcast in high school and that he didn't have many friends or romantic relationships until his mid-20s. By the time he was about 25-26, he behaved like I remembered some of the less-great jocks had behaved at my high school - bullying people for kicks, saying fairly disgusting things about women, always followed by 'it's just a joke'. He also bragged incessantly about his Tinder escapades, for example, I remember him bragging about how he'd slept with a sex worker and didn't pay her (you know, because they were on a date) and about never using condoms. A number of times I remember Herman showing other people nudes that girls had sent him.\n\nWhy was I friends with him at all? Well, he wasn't like how it've just described for the first few years we knew each other, and we had a small group of mutual friends. We had a history, and he was...there. I was conscious we saw the world differently but didn't want to create unnecessary conflict with someone who I expected not to take kindly to any criticism. My former girlfriends from this period of my life called him a mansplainer - I distinctly remember him trying to explain menopause to one of them once.\n\nOne day I called him an 'arrogant misogynist', in our group chat. He'd said something demeaning about women, and, his response to me was that he didn't care about my opinion, and that I was conflict-prone which made my opinions altogether invalid. Am I conflict-prone? I don't think I am exceptionally confrontational, although I had recently had a spat with a roommate which he used against me. I told him that we were talking about his attitudes, not about mine, and that I was calling him out as his friend, because he was saying things that would get someone fired from their job.\n\nAfter this interaction, he began bullying me pretty relentlessly, under the guise of it being a joke. My previous criticism of him was not out of any attack on my person. As his bullying of me continued, my response to him became more personal. I felt like I had to respond to him and stand my ground, even though doing so does often just give a bully more fuel. If I called him out on something, he would tell me not to waste his time. He would say condescending things about my profession, make extreme sexist jokes about the women in my life (wanting to b\\*at up my girlfriend at the time, and r\\*pe my mother), and when I lost my job during the pandemic, shamed me for going on welfare. There was another guy in the group, Jonathan, who would join in with Herman, although the two of them ended up falling out with each other. Jonathan has a long history of aggressive behaviour.\n\nI became s\\*icidal during 2020 for a variety of reasons, and his bullying of me was a contributing factor. He kept bullying me after he'd known I was suicidal; one day, he made a r\\*pe joke about me which he denied was offensive or even a joke about r\\*pe, and then told me that I was delusional and projecting my own behaviour onto him. He also had a go at me for not apologising for calling him various things in retaliation his taunts (which as you can probably imagine did contain some damning condemnations and strong language).\n\nAfter this I cut off contact with Herman, and told him he was an abuser. I drifted away from our mutual friends and avoided Herman, who still saw all of those people. I felt like I'd been bullied out of that group for criticising one person's attitudes. Nobody had really backed me up.\n\nI spiralled quite a bit because I'd lost this group of people. I was pretty lonely and had occasional fantasies about getting back at Herman. I avoided him, which meant that I often didn't go to things because I knew he'd be there.\n\nRecently, another person who'd been in that friendship group told me that everything was my fault and that he 'hoped I wasn't lying to my therapist', insinuating that I was somehow jealous of the person who'd bullied me, and so had made up most of what I've described above. So, a number of my former friends have firmly told me I'm the asshole here; whereas in my mind, Herman has got away with a lot by telling people that I'm unstable.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Bullied out of friendship group", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bullying", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_w6jeuc", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1658625309.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "domain": "self.bullying", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago I began to realise that I really didn&amp;#39;t share the same values as someone I&amp;#39;d been fairly close friends with since my early 20s.

Well, he wasn&amp;#39;t like how it&amp;#39;ve just described for the first few years we knew each other, and we had a small group of mutual friends. We had a history, and he was...there. I was conscious we saw the world differently but didn&amp;#39;t want to create unnecessary conflict with someone who I expected not to take kindly to any criticism. My former girlfriends from this period of my life called him a mansplainer - I distinctly remember him trying to explain menopause to one of them once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day I called him an &amp;#39;arrogant misogynist&amp;#39;, in our group chat. He&amp;#39;d said something demeaning about women, and, his response to me was that he didn&amp;#39;t care about my opinion, and that I was conflict-prone which made my opinions altogether invalid. Am I conflict-prone? I don&amp;#39;t think I am exceptionally confrontational, although I had recently had a spat with a roommate which he used against me. I told him that we were talking about his attitudes, not about mine, and that I was calling him out as his friend, because he was saying things that would get someone fired from their job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After this interaction, he began bullying me pretty relentlessly, under the guise of it being a joke. My previous criticism of him was not out of any attack on my person. As his bullying of me continued, my response to him became more personal. I felt like I had to respond to him and stand my ground, even though doing so does often just give a bully more fuel. If I called him out on something, he would tell me not to waste his time. He would say condescending things about my profession, make extreme sexist jokes about the women in my life (wanting to b*at up my girlfriend at the time, and r*pe my mother), and when I lost my job during the pandemic, shamed me for going on welfare. There was another guy in the group, Jonathan, who would join in with Herman, although the two of them ended up falling out with each other. Jonathan has a long history of aggressive behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I became s*icidal during 2020 for a variety of reasons, and his bullying of me was a contributing factor. He kept bullying me after he&amp;#39;d known I was suicidal; one day, he made a r*pe joke about me which he denied was offensive or even a joke about r*pe, and then told me that I was delusional and projecting my own behaviour onto him. He also had a go at me for not apologising for calling him various things in retaliation his taunts (which as you can probably imagine did contain some damning condemnations and strong language).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After this I cut off contact with Herman, and told him he was an abuser. I drifted away from our mutual friends and avoided Herman, who still saw all of those people. I felt like I&amp;#39;d been bullied out of that group for criticising one person&amp;#39;s attitudes. Nobody had really backed me up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spiralled quite a bit because I&amp;#39;d lost this group of people. I was pretty lonely and had occasional fantasies about getting back at Herman. I avoided him, which meant that I often didn&amp;#39;t go to things because I knew he&amp;#39;d be there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently, another person who&amp;#39;d been in that friendship group told me that everything was my fault and that he &amp;#39;hoped I wasn&amp;#39;t lying to my therapist&amp;#39;, insinuating that I was somehow jealous of the person who&amp;#39;d bullied me, and so had made up most of what I&amp;#39;ve described above. So, a number of my former friends have firmly told me I&amp;#39;m the asshole here; whereas in my mind, Herman has got away with a lot by telling people that I&amp;#39;m unstable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sw9l", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "w6jeuc", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/bullying/comments/w6jeuc/bullied_out_of_friendship_group/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/w6jeuc/bullied_out_of_friendship_group/", "subreddit_subscribers": 7766, "created_utc": 1658625309.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "bullying", "selftext": "My daughter (8) is being targeted by a bully since a year.

We were both studying medicine in the same university and we went to the same primary school. He was a friend of my brother, but he was slightly nerdy. I was never close with him, but my brother mentioned why he committed suicide. He was intelligent, but he had trouble communicating with other people, and in secondary school / high school and university as well, people jested at him, or made fun of him. And that happened to be as well, when I was in primary school. I was the slightly autistic kid, not like Shawn Murphy style, but more like the bookworm who doesn't want to come out of her shell to interact with other kids. I was the type to ask the teacher if there is any homework, because that was what I learned in school: you have classes, and you have work to complete afterwards. Kids nowadays are mean, and they like making fun of others. I remember going to the therapist while I was making arrangements to change schools when I graduated from primary school, just because it was a hell hole for me. Not the teachers, the students made it hell for me.\n\n\\*\\*\n\nMy drawers were sprinkled with sugar, because other students knew my fear of insects, and suddenly I come to school with a drawer of ants. I love borrowing books from library, and I usually store them in my locker if they are too heavy for me to carry home. Our lockers did not have locks, we usually just use them for storage, and one day I was going to return the books after reading them, but they were torn apart. I was crying, not because I have to pay for the damage since I was the one borrowing them, but because books, something that is so valuable and carry so much knowledge, were damaged unknowingly. The funny thing is, I don't remember any of these events happening, until my mother mentioned it today to me. The only remotely bullying event I actually remembered was that other students accused me of cheating in my final exams. It was memorable because I was crying while I took the remaining exams and still managed to score first.\n\n\\*\\*\n\nSo, my question is, do people forget things after speaking about them to a therapist? My mom told me that she was informed about what had happened to me because the school therapist called her up. This happened about 7 years ago, so I'm not sure if 1) I never cared about other students and hence did not connect the dots and realized that they were bullying me; or 2) I learned to forgive and forget (but I strongly doubt this because I hold grudges for quite a long time); or 3) the therapist made me understand what was happening and to protect myself I chose to forget such burdening memories. It would be nice if anyone could offer me advice as to what has happened.

We were both studying medicine in the same university and we went to the same primary school. He was a friend of my brother, but he was slightly nerdy. I was never close with him, but my brother mentioned why he committed suicide. He was intelligent, but he had trouble communicating with other people, and in secondary school / high school and university as well, people jested at him, or made fun of him. And that happened to be as well, when I was in primary school. I was the slightly autistic kid, not like Shawn Murphy style, but more like the bookworm who doesn&amp;#39;t want to come out of her shell to interact with other kids. I was the type to ask the teacher if there is any homework, because that was what I learned in school: you have classes, and you have work to complete afterwards. Kids nowadays are mean, and they like making fun of others. I remember going to the therapist while I was making arrangements to change schools when I graduated from primary school, just because it was a hell hole for me. Not the teachers, the students made it hell for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My drawers were sprinkled with sugar, because other students knew my fear of insects, and suddenly I come to school with a drawer of ants. I love borrowing books from library, and I usually store them in my locker if they are too heavy for me to carry home. Our lockers did not have locks, we usually just use them for storage, and one day I was going to return the books after reading them, but they were torn apart. I was crying, not because I have to pay for the damage since I was the one borrowing them, but because books, something that is so valuable and carry so much knowledge, were damaged unknowingly. The funny thing is, I don&amp;#39;t remember any of these events happening, until my mother mentioned it today to me. The only remotely bullying event I actually remembered was that other students accused me of cheating in my final exams. It was memorable because I was crying while I took the remaining exams and still managed to score first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, my question is, do people forget things after speaking about them to a therapist? My mom told me that she was informed about what had happened to me because the school therapist called her up. This happened about 7 years ago, so I&amp;#39;m not sure if 1) I never cared about other students and hence did not connect the dots and realized that they were bullying me; or 2) I learned to forgive and forget (but I strongly doubt this because I hold grudges for quite a long time); or 3) the therapist made me understand what was happening and to protect myself I chose to forget such burdening memories.

We recommend that you do not continue reading if you are experiencing anxiety and seek professional help.  \nPH (11), an elementary school (SD) boy in Singaparna District, Tasikmalaya Regency, was depressed and died after receiving bullying from his peers.  \n\n\nThe head of the Tasikmalaya Regency KPAI, Ato Rinanto, revealed that the incident was known through recordings on social media that spread. The video shows the victim being forced to fuck a cat by a number of people.  \n\n\n\"So Ananda is 11 years old in the sixth grade, he was suspected of being bullied, until he became depressed. Depression eventually died. The form of bullying was indecent scenes. The victim was forced and threatened by his friends,\" said Tasikmalaya Regency KPAI Chairman Ato Rinanto, Wednesday (20/7) /2022).  \n\n\nWhen met by detikJabar , it was seen that the parents of the victim were still grieving. In a small house with cubicle walls and planks, the parents of victims Ad (41) and Ti (39) are still sad when they tell about the bitter experience that their son suffered.  \n\n\n\"We see that the family is still not in a stable psychological condition, so we offer assistance and psychological recovery, education and possibly the legal process,\" said Ato.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n While speaking softly to the victim's mother, Ti admitted that her son was seriously ill a week before he died. FH complained of a sore throat, which made him reluctant to eat and drink. Victims are more daydreaming and gloomy.  \n\n\nTi did not expect her son to be bullied, because FH only admitted that he had a sore throat. However, Ti's heart broke even more when he saw his second child vomit when he was given water to drink.  \n\n\n\"If we admit that we have a sore throat , we just put water in and vomit again. We took him to the hospital but he died,\" said Ti.  \n\n\nUntil finally, he watched the video of the bullying that happened to his son. He had asked FH why he wanted to do this action.

We recommend that you do not continue reading if you are experiencing anxiety and seek professional help.&lt;br/&gt;\nPH (11), an elementary school (SD) boy in Singaparna District, Tasikmalaya Regency, was depressed and died after receiving bullying from his peers.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The head of the Tasikmalaya Regency KPAI, Ato Rinanto, revealed that the incident was known through recordings on social media that spread. The video shows the victim being forced to fuck a cat by a number of people.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So Ananda is 11 years old in the sixth grade, he was suspected of being bullied, until he became depressed. Depression eventually died. The form of bullying was indecent scenes. The victim was forced and threatened by his friends,&amp;quot; said Tasikmalaya Regency KPAI Chairman Ato Rinanto, Wednesday (20/7) /2022).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When met by detikJabar , it was seen that the parents of the victim were still grieving. In a small house with cubicle walls and planks, the parents of victims Ad (41) and Ti (39) are still sad when they tell about the bitter experience that their son suffered.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We see that the family is still not in a stable psychological condition, so we offer assistance and psychological recovery, education and possibly the legal process,&amp;quot; said Ato.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While speaking softly to the victim&amp;#39;s mother, Ti admitted that her son was seriously ill a week before he died. FH complained of a sore throat, which made him reluctant to eat and drink. Victims are more daydreaming and gloomy.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ti did not expect her son to be bullied, because FH only admitted that he had a sore throat. However, Ti&amp;#39;s heart broke even more when he saw his second child vomit when he was given water to drink.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If we admit that we have a sore throat , we just put water in and vomit again. We took him to the hospital but he died,&amp;quot; said Ti.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until finally, he watched the video of the bullying that happened to his son. He had asked FH why he wanted to do this action. The victim replied that he was coerced and beaten by his peers.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My child often claims to be beaten by his friends.

If you don't mind, allow me to just quickly type out this one story that happened about three years ago and has left me with anger, shame, resentment and bitterness ever since then. You can ridicule me or empathize with me, call me a beta or autist or give me some encouragement, whatever, I just need to share this story, with 100% honesty, so I can air out my feelings and hopefully heal internally and let go of the bitterness.\n\nAbout 4-5 years ago, I moved out of my hometown to a large city to take on a prestigious job. At the time, I was dating a very attractive girl, she was special to me because she was the first girl I had ever dated who was completely thin and slender, so I felt like I had been punching above my weight the whole time I was dating her. Everyone of my previous gf's in the past had been very slightly chubby, so I carried around this constant sense of being flawed or not good enough to attract women who were completely slender. Well she actually left to her home country at the same time I moved to this large city in burgerland, and she ended up officially cutting off the relationship in a really shitty and insulting way (she posted a pic on instagram of herself with another guy and some of her friends, sipping out of a novelty glass labelled \"Ex Boyfriend Tears\") and understandably I was pretty hurt and it took me a while to get over that, however\u2026\n\nOnce I had moved into a rented room at that big city for the new job, I had befriended a roommate who happened to be dating a similar looking, completely slender and pretty girl, while also being unemployed, which I found impressive. I had been reading a bunch of redpill theory stuff online talking about women are attracted to alpha male traits and dominant behavior in men, and figured that this guy must have been sufficiently, naturally alpha to be dating a slender girl like this while still being unemployed, while I had just gotten brutally dumped and insulted by my own, so I was drawn to him and placed a lot of value on that friendship, more than I would have otherwise. I had this feeling deep down, even though I rarely voiced it internally or let it come to the forefront of my mind, that hanging out with this guy and gaining his acceptance and friendship would in turn make me act and feel more alpha, and hopefully I could once again attract women who were completely slender. In all, I had been friends with this guy for two years, the first half when I was rooming with him up until I lost my first job there because it was too stressful, the second half when I had moved up into a rented room further north in the city to take on another job that was slightly less stressful.\n\nThis roommate was overall friendly at first, even though he had a habit sometimes of ignoring me and staring off into his laptop screen while I was talking to him. In fact aside from this, he was overall pretty friendly for the first half of the time I had spent with him, while I was rooming in that same unit with him. Then I lost my first job and moved into that other room up north, and we continued to hang out. \n\nIt's important to note that I was incredibly stressed during this whole time, that first job I got fired from was incredibly stressful, the second job, while not as stressful, had a very long commute even further up north, and I was seriously doubting my intelligence and feeling like a retard for having spent about $160k of my parents money on an engineering degree that I was turning out to be too dumb to use for any 'big boy' job. Add to that the fact I was trying to get over my ex, the best looking and most special girl I had ever dated, breaking up with me in such an insulting way, my happiness and my self esteem were plummeting during this time. I was feeling vaguely suicidal and had even confided this with my friend, to which he made some nonchalant comment like \"Damn that's crazy\". Yet, after I had moved up to that room further up north for the second job, when I asked my friend if he could occasionally share the work of us hanging out by taking the metro up to my new room instead of me driving over to pick him up, drive him up to my place so we could play League on my PC, then drive him back to his place and return to my room up north in the city, he flat out refused. \n\nIn fact the friendship was really looking one sided at the time, even though I wasn't aware of it at the time. I gave him rides from work pretty often, and there were a handful of times I had paid for his meals when we went to eat out when he was unemployed and had no income. I had always been pretty bad at communication, lacking in assertiveness and not knowing how or when to stand up for myself and that was probably becoming more and more apparent in this friendship. One time he smiled at me while we were chilling on the couch and said \"Fuck you\", probably what he thought was a joke but I laughed it off, and there were two or three times that he randomly placed his hand on my shoulder and held it there for a few seconds while giving me a blank look. \n\nThis hand on my shoulder gesture, I didn't think much about it at the time, I thought it was just his quirky way of expressing friendship but in retrospect I realized that was incredibly patronizing and I should *not* have been okay with that. But at the time when he did that I probably just laughed it off or chuckled and continued with whatever we were talking about or doing.\n\nFast forward to about 10 months into that time I had moved up north, two months before I had left for good to my hometown. I was starting up another round of League with my friend sitting beside me, and I scrolled through some boards here just to catch some memes while the game was loading. I scrolled through /pol/ really quick and he noticed and asked what kind of fucking racist website is this? (This roommate/friend was a far left redditor type of guy) I explained to him it was the politics board but I only looked through it some times for the memes and news.\n\nHe gave me a side glance but didn't say much more. Later that day when I allowed him to play League on my PC (in the main living room) while I had gone upstairs to take a short nap, I started hearing this banging sound coming from downstairs, sounding like he was pounding the table. I went downstairs and walked towards the living area, and saw that the cover to my mouse to hold the batteries in was separated from the mouse. I asked him what that was about and he said \"Oh I dunno\". It turns out when he was losing to any plays he was making in League he was just banging my mouse against the table in frustration. I told him \"Easy, easy\" but then he replied \"Why does it matter dude?\".\n\nThen came my turn to play a round since I had come downstairs. I made this one bad play, and he called me an idiot. By that time, I was picking up on a lot of unnecessary hostility and disrespect from him so I just turned around and bared my teeth and told him 'No', to which after twenty seconds he gave a very reluctant sounding apology. I told him to pack his stuff and that I was driving him back to his place, and he just remained quiet the whole time. However, once I got back home, after I had called my mom to vent about breaking off the friendship with someone I thought was my best friend, she encouraged me to forgive him and that he was probably stressed form his new job that he had started weeks earlier, so I did so. I texted him to say no hard feelings, and he thanked me and agreed that he was taking out the stress from his job on me. So we continued hanging out each weekend for the slightly less than two months I was enduring that city and the stressful job. And he seemed overall friendly during this time. \n\nSo now it's the final day I was at that city and putting up with that incredibly stressful job and commute. I was feeling very worn out, up to my limit, had suicidal thoughts passing in and out of my head. I decided that was the day I just tell my boss I was done with that job, if he could provide a good letter of reference in the future that would be great and that I was moving back home. Unexpectedly I was crying slightly when I was telling my boss this, not bawling but the amount of frustration and disappointment I was holding within myself really let loose then, and he was very nice and understanding. I text my friend who I had felt I had already reconciled with at this time that I had had enough of that city and that job, that I was going home for good, and asked him if he wanted to hang out one last time before I return home, to which he agreed.\n\nSo after stopping by at my room to pack all my stuff and throw it all into my car, I arrive at his place so we can get some drinks from the convenience store and play one last round or two of League. This guy immediately greets me by horsing around with me slightly like a fighting game character (he was a big fan of street fighter) by throwing fake, light punches at me, and then I could tell immediately he was dropping all niceties with me and trying to disrespect me as much as he could before I left, but I didn't feel like saying anything because I just felt too exhausted and defeated. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and thought this had to do with me scrolling through /pol/ that one day and he simply didn't approve of the content there, which I could understand.\n\nSo for those last two hours I hung out with him before driving home, in addition to those light, playful punches he threw, he made that one gesture one last time where he placed his hand on my shoulder for a few seconds, and asked if I was stupid when I asked him a question about League during that one last match we played,  and lastly before I said my last goodbyes to him and the other roommate he said with a smirk \"What a shame, wish we could have you here\". I drove home, and enjoyed my first month or so of freedom from that job. \n\nHowever, I reflected more and more upon all of his treatment of me as a whole, realized maybe he didn't even care that much that I had briefly scrolled through some racist website and felt like bullying or treating like shit someone who was vulnerable and down on his self esteem right in front of him, and I felt completely taken advantage of too, considering I had bought him a handful of meals while he was unemployed, was always giving him rides from work once he did get his job and always let him play League on my PC, even smashing the mouse like that on that one day. I just reviews all the disrespect from him and the one sided nature of that friendship and began to feel angrier than I had ever felt before, not just anger at him but anger at myself for having let him walk all over me and disrespect me like that. \n\nAnother angle which made all that behavior hurt so bad was I began to see it all as assertions of dominance. With all those assertions of dominance, he probably walked out of that one sided friendship feeling more alpha while I was forced to feel incredibly beta, or even a bi\u2020ch to an outside observer. Again, these were really painful realizations to be made but that's exactly why I'm typing this all out right now, I just have to share this entire story in detail to SOMEONE out there, besides my parents (who wouldn't really understand these things anyway) and my therapist. And yea, maybe on top of seeming incredibly beta during this whole situation, maybe there's the chance I've always had some slight autism going on that prevented me from having a gut feeling to avoid this person and cut off the friendship. \n\nNonetheless, there were the reasons I outlined before why I continued to hang out with this guy 1)I had always tended to be a people pleaser and a doormat in previous friendships and was happy to take on a slightly submissive role to keep the friendship afloat, even though those previous friendships were nowhere near this one sided 2) I was incredibly stressed and depressed in that city with those jobs and simply wanted *a* friend to hang out with over the weekends and 3) like I said before, hanging out with this guy subconsciously made me feel more alpha and therefore more attractive to women who were completely slender like the special girlfriend that dumped me right when I had moved to the city.\n\nAnother thing that really hurt about that whole friendship was the hand on my shoulder gesture. I didn't think about it much each time he did it, I thought it was just his quirky way of expressing friendship, but really that was an extremely patronizing gesture and I should NOT have been okay with that. Maybe the first two or three times he did it were permissible, but the last time he did it, on the final day I said my final goodbyes and he was trying to make it clear that he didn't give a fuck about me the whole time and that I had outlived my usefulness to him, I should have reacted with a lot more anger or agitation, or at least pulled away from him. For one man to place his hand on another man's shoulder, if they aren't explicitly close friends, could be taken to mean \"I own you\" or \"You're my bi\u2020\u00a0 ch\". I didn't interpret the gesture that way before I returned home three years ago, but now I do and it just eats at me every day that I allowed myself to look and act so beta in this guy's company and that I didn't instinctively feel angrier or more agitated when he placed his hand on my shoulder like that. \n\nSo yea, I think I'm going to wrap up this story by saying that is has been three years since I had returned home from that big city and the stressful job, and that abusive roommate, and I still feel intense mixtures of feelings from his treatment of me that include anger, resentment, shame, bitterness, feeling really fucking beta / autistic / unattractive to women this entire time, low self esteem etc. Now of course, I'm a whole lot better at being assertive when the time calls for it, standing up for myself, setting boundaries, avoiding toxic people like that roommate, but man the pain has been unbearable and still persists. I've started seeing a therapist and have gone to about ten sessions with him and he has really helped, but I also feel like I need to share this story with OTHER people and not just him. I hope you can understand why I felt so angry and bitter this whole time. \n\nThat roommate can probably continue to enjoy dating pretty, slender women while I'm coasting through my early thirties trying to overcome these brain problems, but will also have to contend with being, naturally, slightly low IQ and autistic, so much so even though I have spent ~160k of my parents money on an engineering degree from a fancy private college, I may in fact be too dumb to hold any job that pays more than $25 an hour. But you know what, I still am holding out some hope for myself, typing out this whole story in detail helped, and maybe if I can let go of all this anger and bitterness and resentment, I can learn to code or some other similar high paying skill and actually earn decent money", "author_fullname": "t2_2vy79mxe", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "I need to share this resentful and bitter situation I've been struggling to get over", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bullying", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_w1mx65", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1658107538.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.bullying", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey reddit. If you don&amp;#39;t mind, allow me to just quickly type out this one story that happened about three years ago and has left me with anger, shame, resentment and bitterness ever since then. You can ridicule me or empathize with me, call me a beta or autist or give me some encouragement, whatever, I just need to share this story, with 100% honesty, so I can air out my feelings and hopefully heal internally and let go of the bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About 4-5 years ago, I moved out of my hometown to a large city to take on a prestigious job. At the time, I was dating a very attractive girl, she was special to me because she was the first girl I had ever dated who was completely thin and slender, so I felt like I had been punching above my weight the whole time I was dating her. Everyone of my previous gf&amp;#39;s in the past had been very slightly chubby, so I carried around this constant sense of being flawed or not good enough to attract women who were completely slender. Well she actually left to her home country at the same time I moved to this large city in burgerland, and she ended up officially cutting off the relationship in a really shitty and insulting way (she posted a pic on instagram of herself with another guy and some of her friends, sipping out of a novelty glass labelled &amp;quot;Ex Boyfriend Tears&amp;quot;) and understandably I was pretty hurt and it took me a while to get over that, however\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once I had moved into a rented room at that big city for the new job, I had befriended a roommate who happened to be dating a similar looking, completely slender and pretty girl, while also being unemployed, which I found impressive. I had been reading a bunch of redpill theory stuff online talking about women are attracted to alpha male traits and dominant behavior in men, and figured that this guy must have been sufficiently, naturally alpha to be dating a slender girl like this while still being unemployed, while I had just gotten brutally dumped and insulted by my own, so I was drawn to him and placed a lot of value on that friendship, more than I would have otherwise. I had this feeling deep down, even though I rarely voiced it internally or let it come to the forefront of my mind, that hanging out with this guy and gaining his acceptance and friendship would in turn make me act and feel more alpha, and hopefully I could once again attract women who were completely slender. In all, I had been friends with this guy for two years, the first half when I was rooming with him up until I lost my first job there because it was too stressful, the second half when I had moved up into a rented room further north in the city to take on another job that was slightly less stressful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This roommate was overall friendly at first, even though he had a habit sometimes of ignoring me and staring off into his laptop screen while I was talking to him. In fact aside from this, he was overall pretty friendly for the first half of the time I had spent with him, while I was rooming in that same unit with him. Then I lost my first job and moved into that other room up north, and we continued to hang out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s important to note that I was incredibly stressed during this whole time, that first job I got fired from was incredibly stressful, the second job, while not as stressful, had a very long commute even further up north, and I was seriously doubting my intelligence and feeling like a retard for having spent about $160k of my parents money on an engineering degree that I was turning out to be too dumb to use for any &amp;#39;big boy&amp;#39; job. Add to that the fact I was trying to get over my ex, the best looking and most special girl I had ever dated, breaking up with me in such an insulting way, my happiness and my self esteem were plummeting during this time. I was feeling vaguely suicidal and had even confided this with my friend, to which he made some nonchalant comment like &amp;quot;Damn that&amp;#39;s crazy&amp;quot;. Yet, after I had moved up to that room further up north for the second job, when I asked my friend if he could occasionally share the work of us hanging out by taking the metro up to my new room instead of me driving over to pick him up, drive him up to my place so we could play League on my PC, then drive him back to his place and return to my room up north in the city, he flat out refused. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact the friendship was really looking one sided at the time, even though I wasn&amp;#39;t aware of it at the time. I gave him rides from work pretty often, and there were a handful of times I had paid for his meals when we went to eat out when he was unemployed and had no income. I had always been pretty bad at communication, lacking in assertiveness and not knowing how or when to stand up for myself and that was probably becoming more and more apparent in this friendship. One time he smiled at me while we were chilling on the couch and said &amp;quot;Fuck you&amp;quot;, probably what he thought was a joke but I laughed it off, and there were two or three times that he randomly placed his hand on my shoulder and held it there for a few seconds while giving me a blank look. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This hand on my shoulder gesture, I didn&amp;#39;t think much about it at the time, I thought it was just his quirky way of expressing friendship but in retrospect I realized that was incredibly patronizing and I should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have been okay with that.

Me being the outgoing and friendly person I am, I expected to make lots of friends with coworkers, who were all around my age and enjoyed partying as much as I do. I immediately got lots of attention from the male servers, which is expected but may have made some of the girls envious. One of my male coworkers started making fun of me a lot and I figured he was just flirting until I realized he was being completely serious when he started to cuss me out randomly at work for no reason. This bully also happened to be everyone\u2019s favorite coworker. He would stalk my location and found out that I was hanging out with one of my male coworkers. He told everyone in the group chat that I was sleeping with this guy which really upset me. To this day I have no idea why this guy chose to bully me. When I asked him, he just said bc I\u2019m \u201c(insert my name.)\u201d At one point, a few other guys said that he was taking it too far but at the end of the day everyone sided with him since he threw all the big parties and I was just the new girl (that everyone calls a whore now). The moment I started to show my dislike for him, i never got invited to any hangouts besides guys trying to hookup.\nFast forward to now, months after this guy was fired (but still hangs out with all my coworkers) I brought up the bullying to a couple of my male coworkers. One of them literally said \u201cOMG the pretty, popular former cheer captain gets bullied for the first time BOOHOO.\u201d This pissed me off bc while it\u2019s true I was popular in high school, that doesn\u2019t mean what happened to me was deserved.

Me being the outgoing and friendly person I am, I expected to make lots of friends with coworkers, who were all around my age and enjoyed partying as much as I do. I immediately got lots of attention from the male servers, which is expected but may have made some of the girls envious. One of my male coworkers started making fun of me a lot and I figured he was just flirting until I realized he was being completely serious when he started to cuss me out randomly at work for no reason. This bully also happened to be everyone\u2019s favorite coworker. He would stalk my location and found out that I was hanging out with one of my male coworkers. He told everyone in the group chat that I was sleeping with this guy which really upset me. To this day I have no idea why this guy chose to bully me. When I asked him, he just said bc I\u2019m \u201c(insert my name.)\u201d At one point, a few other guys said that he was taking it too far but at the end of the day everyone sided with him since he threw all the big parties and I was just the new girl (that everyone calls a whore now). The moment I started to show my dislike for him, i never got invited to any hangouts besides guys trying to hookup.\nFast forward to now, months after this guy was fired (but still hangs out with all my coworkers) I brought up the bullying to a couple of my male coworkers. One of them literally said \u201cOMG the pretty, popular former cheer captain gets bullied for the first time BOOHOO.\u201d This pissed me off bc while it\u2019s true I was popular in high school, that doesn\u2019t mean what happened to me was deserved. I never bullied anyone and I was only popular bc I was kind to everybody. Being popular also doesn\u2019t mean my life was easy, the popular guy I dated throughout high school was abusing me sexually and emotionally. I was suicidal until recently.

I considered myself to be normal atleast to my standards. But I originally was born in Milan, Italy then I moved to the UK. When I moved to the UK I had no language barriers as I knew English from beforehand. I don't know what it was but I had chills through my spines during my first day at high school. I just had a feeling something wasn't right and I was correct as from day 1 I started to get bullied.\n\nFrom people calling me smelly to weird and what not. But I have to admit something embarassing though; I never knew how children were made. I obviously know it now but I didn't know what it meant back then. Since then rumours spread around school that I could be dumb, gay, brain damaged and more. I got used to the taunting by then. Some of you may be asking why didn't I fight back? Well, I wanted to millions of times but there were like 5 of them and one of me. I thought the logical decision would be to accept it unless I wanna leave with broken bones or something even more riskier whilst in school. So, I just accepted it and the bullying continued. \n\nBut something surprising happened after summer break. I started liking this girl in my class. Mind you she was one of my bullies as well. But she didn't bully me as severely as the others yet. I knew she was my bully and it was wrong but I didn't know was it because she was pretty or what but I couldn't help falling for her. Eventually people noticed and rumours started to spread around school and obviously people had even more reasons to pick on me now as she was popular many guys wanted to be with her.\n\nI usually take the bus stop home. I guess she and her friends might've noticed me there because after the rumours about me liking her started to spread I noticed that her and her friends would come by to the bust stop and ask me many questions. One time they recorded me on snapchat without my permission in the bus stop in front of everyone and uploaded it online saying that my outfit and hair looked ridiculous. Also, I found this out by another one of my classmate before she threw a laptop in my face. \n\nThat wasn't the end of the bus stop visits because another time I bought a gift for her on her birthday and she threw the sunglasses and Scarf I had given for her saying that they had curry stains on it. I know that was stupid of me back then I had no self respect and it was cringe but to me it seemed normal.\n\nAnother bus stop visit was the most extreme which I even remember the date due the incident being carved in my mind. It was September 27, 2018 and this time they were embarassing me infront of everyone and I had enough (And I know this was wrong on my part) but due to my rage I ended up calling one of the girls a hoe. After that they threw their Ice creams at me ruining my school uniform as I stnd there embarassed of what just went down in a public place. I go back and a teacher comforts me as I wash down my dirt but nothing happened of them after they did that. \n\nCouple months later after Christmas break I confess my feelings but she starts laughing and we never talked about that again. \n\nAfter that one of her best friends one day came to me and said that she wants me to go on a date with her. I was actually excited but then I realize when I go to the destination they were just there to laugh and mock again. \n\nThis kept continuing meanwhile in my homeroom class I was being bullied by a South Asian guy who was sure I was gay so he kept harassing me. So I end up missing my homeroom for about 3-4 months before I get moved to another homeroom class. Meanwhile all of this was happening many people joined in the bullying seeing I was an easy target. Many ridicilous rumours followed around and amongst all of that PE  was the worst as I wasn't the sporty type so was made fun for that as well.\n\nAll of this crap kept happening with everyone and the so called friends I had they were only my friends to spread news about me to their actual friends. Well, Alas after all of that I eventually did graduate high school with good grades except for geography. \n\nThen I go to college and my bullies I don't hear from them much except some of them. The guy that bullied me during homeroom had the same classes as me in college but he didn't bother me at all there I don't know what happened but he never bullied me when we went to college.

I considered myself to be normal atleast to my standards. But I originally was born in Milan, Italy then I moved to the UK. When I moved to the UK I had no language barriers as I knew English from beforehand. I don&amp;#39;t know what it was but I had chills through my spines during my first day at high school. I just had a feeling something wasn&amp;#39;t right and I was correct as from day 1 I started to get bullied.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From people calling me smelly to weird and what not. But I have to admit something embarassing though; I never knew how children were made. I obviously know it now but I didn&amp;#39;t know what it meant back then. Since then rumours spread around school that I could be dumb, gay, brain damaged and more. I got used to the taunting by then. Some of you may be asking why didn&amp;#39;t I fight back? Well, I wanted to millions of times but there were like 5 of them and one of me. I thought the logical decision would be to accept it unless I wanna leave with broken bones or something even more riskier whilst in school. So, I just accepted it and the bullying continued. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But something surprising happened after summer break. I started liking this girl in my class. Mind you she was one of my bullies as well. But she didn&amp;#39;t bully me as severely as the others yet. I knew she was my bully and it was wrong but I didn&amp;#39;t know was it because she was pretty or what but I couldn&amp;#39;t help falling for her. Eventually people noticed and rumours started to spread around school and obviously people had even more reasons to pick on me now as she was popular many guys wanted to be with her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I usually take the bus stop home. I guess she and her friends might&amp;#39;ve noticed me there because after the rumours about me liking her started to spread I noticed that her and her friends would come by to the bust stop and ask me many questions. One time they recorded me on snapchat without my permission in the bus stop in front of everyone and uploaded it online saying that my outfit and hair looked ridiculous. Also, I found this out by another one of my classmate before she threw a laptop in my face. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That wasn&amp;#39;t the end of the bus stop visits because another time I bought a gift for her on her birthday and she threw the sunglasses and Scarf I had given for her saying that they had curry stains on it. I know that was stupid of me back then I had no self respect and it was cringe but to me it seemed normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another bus stop visit was the most extreme which I even remember the date due the incident being carved in my mind. It was September 27, 2018 and this time they were embarassing me infront of everyone and I had enough (And I know this was wrong on my part) but due to my rage I ended up calling one of the girls a hoe. After that they threw their Ice creams at me ruining my school uniform as I stnd there embarassed of what just went down in a public place. I go back and a teacher comforts me as I wash down my dirt but nothing happened of them after they did that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Couple months later after Christmas break I confess my feelings but she starts laughing and we never talked about that again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that one of her best friends one day came to me and said that she wants me to go on a date with her. I was actually excited but then I realize when I go to the destination they were just there to laugh and mock again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This kept continuing meanwhile in my homeroom class I was being bullied by a South Asian guy who was sure I was gay so he kept harassing me. So I end up missing my homeroom for about 3-4 months before I get moved to another homeroom class. Meanwhile all of this was happening many people joined in the bullying seeing I was an easy target. Many ridicilous rumours followed around and amongst all of that PE  was the worst as I wasn&amp;#39;t the sporty type so was made fun for that as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of this crap kept happening with everyone and the so called friends I had they were only my friends to spread news about me to their actual friends. Well, Alas after all of that I eventually did graduate high school with good grades except for geography. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I go to college and my bullies I don&amp;#39;t hear from them much except some of them. The guy that bullied me during homeroom had the same classes as me in college but he didn&amp;#39;t bother me at all there I don&amp;#39;t know what happened but he never bullied me when we went to college.  I saw one of the friends of the girl I had a crush on recently on a supermarket but she just gave me a stare nothing else. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two guys that wanted to date the girl that I had a crush on teamed up and made a rumour that I was gay and spread it around but I didn&amp;#39;t have time for them and I don&amp;#39;t know what became of them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the friends of the girl I met the other day and she was still as annoying as ever and didn&amp;#39;t seem to mature at all as she said I was quite the funny guy back in high school but haven&amp;#39;t heard from her since.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the girl I had a crush on after I went to college I heard that her brother passed away so it was hard for her family. I comforted her and also shared her story around to donate for her brother. She and I resolved our issues but I&amp;#39;m not sure.

He threatened to arrest us and said we deserved to get physically attacked and mugged because of our &amp;quot;attitude&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly.. I just feel like hurting myself. I&amp;#39;m so low. Wanted to cry all day. I feel like people are always horrible to me and I feel worthless. I feel 9 times out of 10 people only talk to me when they want something or are throwing negativity in my direction &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suffer from body image issues too and bipolar disorder so it&amp;#39;s been so horrible all day having people come at me out the blue and comment on my appearance &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so low :(&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: also did some research on Blackpool today and it&amp;#39;s one of the most violent places in Britain&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [{"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": null, "coin_price": 80, "id": "award_8352bdff-3e03-4189-8a08-82501dd8f835", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "GLOBAL", "coin_reward": 0, "icon_url": "https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png", "days_of_premium": null, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73a23bf7f08b633508dedf457f2704c522b94a04", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50f2f16e71d2929e3d7275060af3ad6b851dbfb1", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca487311563425e195699a4d7e4c57a98cbfde8b", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b4eedcffb1c09a826e7837532c52979760f1d2b", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4d5ab237eb71a9f02bb3bf9ad5ee43741918d6c", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 2048, "static_icon_width": 2048, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "Everything is better with a good hug", "end_date": null, "sticky_duration_seconds": null, "subreddit_coin_reward": 0, "count": 1, "static_icon_height": 2048, "name": "Hugz", "resized_static_icons": [{"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69997ace3ef4ffc099b81d774c2c8f1530602875", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9519d1999ef9dce5c8a9f59369cb92f52d95319", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f076c6434fb2d2f9075991810fd845c40fa73fc6", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85527145e0c4b754306a30df29e584fd16187636", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8843cdf82c3b741d7af057c14076dcd2621e811", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_format": "PNG", "icon_height": 2048, "penny_price": 0, "award_type": "global", "static_icon_url": "https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png"}], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sw9l", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "vxpgtb", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ParticularLeather500", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 37, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/bullying/comments/vxpgtb/had_the_worst_day_ever/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/vxpgtb/had_the_worst_day_ever/", "subreddit_subscribers": 7766, "created_utc": 1657670685.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "bullying", "selftext": "I don\u2019t why but anything sets me off.

She had a fair share of Boyfriend 22m and none of them really bothered me but her recent boyfriend really has some weird superiority complex in making me feel insecure and insignificant. At the beginning he was just a friend of hers in the group but it slowly development into a relationship after his ex girlfriend cheated in him and backstabbing my sister making them kinda grow together and ending up with them dating.(it's a different story) Him and his family are fairly weathly and his Overall social status is doing alright. So I had no problems with him dating my sister. It's just that I noticed that he has some weird scheme of talking me down all the time. When I have a new haircut he talks it bad. When I buy a used gaming setup he brags about him having the newest graphics card and talking shit about my PC. Basically 1/3 times we are in a group of friends and it's being talked about me He takes the intuitive to badmouth me intentionally in humourous way. He seems to get his information about me from my sister to use against me that's why I'm getting furious that he know stuff about me he has absolutely no business of knowing. He is well liked by my family because his family is running multiple businesses in town so they see him as a proficient future husband. Me on the other hand he seems to despise in some way. He never starts a conversation with me privatly. When I did in the past they were all yes/no answers. My sister doesn't seems to be aware about our feud. Although I made it clear in the family that this guy's not someone I consider family.\nIt's been a year now and a live in another city but we see each other on family dinners occasionally.\nWe don't talk.

She had a fair share of Boyfriend 22m and none of them really bothered me but her recent boyfriend really has some weird superiority complex in making me feel insecure and insignificant. At the beginning he was just a friend of hers in the group but it slowly development into a relationship after his ex girlfriend cheated in him and backstabbing my sister making them kinda grow together and ending up with them dating.(it&amp;#39;s a different story) Him and his family are fairly weathly and his Overall social status is doing alright. So I had no problems with him dating my sister. It&amp;#39;s just that I noticed that he has some weird scheme of talking me down all the time. When I have a new haircut he talks it bad. When I buy a used gaming setup he brags about him having the newest graphics card and talking shit about my PC. Basically 1/3 times we are in a group of friends and it&amp;#39;s being talked about me He takes the intuitive to badmouth me intentionally in humourous way. He seems to get his information about me from my sister to use against me that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m getting furious that he know stuff about me he has absolutely no business of knowing. He is well liked by my family because his family is running multiple businesses in town so they see him as a proficient future husband. Me on the other hand he seems to despise in some way. He never starts a conversation with me privatly. When I did in the past they were all yes/no answers. My sister doesn&amp;#39;t seems to be aware about our feud. Although I made it clear in the family that this guy&amp;#39;s not someone I consider family.\nIt&amp;#39;s been a year now and a live in another city but we see each other on family dinners occasionally.\nWe don&amp;#39;t talk.

too much into the situation as I tend to be quite sensitive. What I want to know if my situation counts as work place bullying and should I report it? Or am I just making a mountain out of a mole hill?\n\nAt my work I am in charge of the students we get coming through. One of the staff members complained that a student had told him how to do his job and he wanted it dealt with immediately. We have not had any issues with this student in fact I had had many compliments regarding him from other staff members. I spoke to the student and he said he hadn\u2019t mean to offend the staff member at all and that the staff must have misunderstood what he was saying. Even so the student agreed to apologise. I explained this to the staff member and he said ok and thank you. About 10mins later I received a long email from the staff member regarding the incident saying he wanted a formal written reply from me with how the situation was handled or he\u2019d go to our manager. Since he wanted a written reply I decided to ask the student to write in email to me his side of the story. When I received the email from the student his story did not match up with the staff member\u2019s for example the student said that he tried to explain himself when the staff member got mad at him the staff member makes no mention of this. The staff member also said he told the student to stop talking and the student decided to leave the room after that. Whilst the student claims he was told to stop talking and leave. Staff member says he spoke kindly during the incident. Student says this wasn\u2019t the case Student mentioned he actually was very unhappy with how he was treated by the staff member and only agreed to apologise so there was no bad blood. ( which I know feel bad for getting him to apologise for without knowing the whole story)\n\nAnyway I wasn\u2019t sure what to make of the situation. So I replied to the staff member saying that yes I could understand that he was upset and the student has promised to be more mindful of how he says things but also that the student was upset with how he was treated so he needed to be careful with how he presented himself to students. I asked if I could forward his email to our manager as I wasn\u2019t sure what to make of the situation which he agreed to. Student agreed for his email to be sent too.\n\n My manager then called me later saying that he\u2019d just had a 30mins convo with the staff member and he explained to him that yes we don\u2019t tolerate insubordination however sometimes students will test our patience but we need to remain professional and keep our cool. He asked if I would happy to leave the incident alone now which of course I was as I had had enough of it. He asked the other staff member this too\n\nNow the question of bullying (sorry for the long back story) ever since the incident the staff member has been ignoring me. At first I thought it was all in  my head (being sensitive) for example when I called him from another site he spoke very monotone (use to be very upbeat) but then he deleted all messenger messages he\u2019d ever sent me, which I\u2019m not going to lie hurt me to see those notifications . Today I said hi to him in the morning and he just ignored me and said hi to someone else (ok maybe he didn\u2019t hear).At mid day I asked how his day was going (no one else in the room) and he snaps \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me, only talk to me if it is client related \u201c which pretty much confirmed that he is ignoring Me.

And threaten us....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I said I lied about a report so I&amp;#39;d stop getting bullied about making the report... by my entire community....\nThe bullies kidnapped my kid and lied about me calling me so many things I&amp;#39;ve never been.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then claim that me standing up for myself is the misbehavior, and that the abusive behavior that makes me need to stand up for myself is not bad...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine being bullied by a cult that took over your city, this is the way of genocidal dictatorships that caused world wars. And you all just take part in it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do you sue people for abuse when the judges refuse to review all of the facts of the matter. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you don&amp;#39;t WANT to take the time to review it. You are a judge it&amp;#39;s your job to do what&amp;#39;s right... not what your faith deems is right, it&amp;#39;s your job to not align your moral compass with abusive religions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People who follow god only use that faith as an excuse to abuse us.
