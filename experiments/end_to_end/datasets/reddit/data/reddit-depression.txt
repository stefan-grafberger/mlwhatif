Just googling doesn\u00b4t help anymore, since I only find articles that talk about how much woke is allegedly bullying people, even though I feel ostracized the most.

We own a home and have planned to spend our lives together. \n\nA year ago, my boyfriend decided to go on Lexapro because he experiences what his doctor believed to be \u201canxiety attacks\u201d once a month, at the same time every month (please also comment if you\u2019ve ever heard of something like this). The \u201canxiety attacks\u201d have continued, so his doctor wants him to get off the Lexapro and see a psychiatrist to rule out anything going on with his brain because his doctor no longer believes he\u2019s experiencing \u201canxiety attacks\u201d. The downside is that the Lexapro has a number of known side effects, all of which he has been dealing with the past year since going on them. There have been a lot of changes with his behavior and his personality since going on this medication, which I have previously posted about when seeking guidance for how to best support him. \n\nThe most recent change is that he believes he no longer wants to have kids. He *thinks* he doesn\u2019t want to have kids anymore. He says he *might* change his mind in the future but, right now, he thinks he doesn\u2019t want them. This is a complete 180 on his part; we had the discussion about kids very early on in our relationship and he said he wanted them and would do whatever it took to be a dad (i.e. IVF, surrogacy, etc). He is also an uncle and is amazing with his nieces and nephews. Even as recent as 6 months ago, he was talking about looking forward to having kids with me. \n\nAs a symptom of his depression, he doesn\u2019t *want* to do anything anymore, so this change doesn\u2019t completely surprise me and is part of the reason I\u2019m hesitant to fully \u201cbelieve\u201d it. At the same time, I want to make it clear I would never pressure him into doing something he doesn\u2019t want to do. If he doesn\u2019t want kids, I won\u2019t have kids with him. What I\u2019m trying to figure out is if this medication can be contributing to this sudden change before I decide what I want to do. \n\nI love kids. My entire career revolves around kids. I have always wanted to be a mom. With that said, I\u2019ve shared some of his doubts about that major life change such as finances, the state of our world, stress, etc. However, I still come out wanting to be a mom - and so did he until recently. \n\nI now have to decide what I want to do with this information. I don\u2019t want to discredit him, but there have been so many changes since he\u2019s gone on Lexapro that it\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s \u201creal\u201d and what\u2019s the Lexapro.\n\nHas anyone faced these changes as a result of depression/anxiety or SSRIs?", "author_fullname": "t2_589uif08", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "My boyfriend of over two years let me know he thinks he no longer wants to have kids.", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_vcn4jl", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1655270952.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.depression", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (28F) have been with my boyfriend (31M) for over two years.

No, not mine; they&amp;#39;ve said I&amp;#39;m a burden. I&amp;#39;m the odd one out, everyone is distant with me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always been an isolated person, and my safe haven was and continues to be my home. to work or to work or to work or to work or to work or to work or to work There is only one person was my friend at school. Bulling was there at the time. I mostly kept to myself, studying and trying to finish school trying to make my parents somewhat proud of me although they didn\u2019t care much.I went from being a good student with good grades and confidence in my abilities to feeling uneasy and apprehensive. Everything consumed by self hatred and apathy with life andsabotaged by self-doubt. Now I imagine people my age being accepted to their dream schools and pursuing their dreams. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I\u2019m currently dealing with my anxiety. I&amp;#39;m still unable to go out much, let alone call people online or in person. Plus, I appear uninteresting to myself and people have told me close people, and even when I do talk, I struggle to talk to people or don&amp;#39;t know what to say. I&amp;#39;ll make comments here and there, take calls, and so on. However, I am unable to hold a conversation or form any kind of friendship or relationship. For myself, I believe it is best to die.

Just went through a rough breakup with my previous boyfriend, have been super sick and bedridden for almost a week, and I really want someone to take care of me. Like, out of genuine care. Not because they feel like they have to or because they\u2019ll think they can get sex from me if they do. I just want to feel real warmth from another human. I haven\u2019t in atleast a year and a half. Even when I was with my boyfriend, I could never believe or trust him or his motives due to his lying problem. I haven\u2019t had a raw warm connection with someone in a very long time. \n\nBut I don\u2019t have someone to baby me and care for me right now as I feel super shitty and sick. And I can\u2019t help but think it\u2019s because I AM the problem. Not my exes, not my family, not previous friends. Me. I am the reason no one shows me warmth and shows initiative to care for me. \nMy borderline personality disorder truly has made me unloveable, and if I ever think for a damn minute that I will ever find someone that sees the beauty in me that I see in myself, I better snap out of it. I will rot alone, and it\u2019s because I\u2019m not special.

Just went through a rough breakup with my previous boyfriend, have been super sick and bedridden for almost a week, and I really want someone to take care of me. Like, out of genuine care. Not because they feel like they have to or because they\u2019ll think they can get sex from me if they do. I just want to feel real warmth from another human. I haven\u2019t in atleast a year and a half. Even when I was with my boyfriend, I could never believe or trust him or his motives due to his lying problem. I haven\u2019t had a raw warm connection with someone in a very long time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I don\u2019t have someone to baby me and care for me right now as I feel super shitty and sick. And I can\u2019t help but think it\u2019s because I AM the problem. Not my exes, not my family, not previous friends. Me. I am the reason no one shows me warmth and shows initiative to care for me. \nMy borderline personality disorder truly has made me unloveable, and if I ever think for a damn minute that I will ever find someone that sees the beauty in me that I see in myself, I better snap out of it.

I love my boyfriend more than anything else in the world. He's honestly the only thing that's been keeping me alive. (I have severe anxiety and depression, and my will to live rests on him). \n\nWe've been living together for 5 months and after the first month we've ironed out all the typical issues that's come with first moving in together. (Trying to live a life with someone else and getting used to it). \n\nWe have two roommates, J (21m) and F (20m). Both have been have girlfriend and have been dating said girlfriends for 3 years and 1 year. \n\nNow my boyfriend isn't conventional my type. I was kind of promiscuous in college and liked the stereotypical Douche bag wattpad bad boys. He is nothing like that. He has a great job, is super smart, and plays video games. He's very sweet and caring, and has made it very clear that I'm the love of his life, his soul mate, and he wants to marry me. I very much feel the same way. I've changed alot for him, and he got me to seek help with all my issues.\n\nI moved here from a different state. Im talking east coast to west coast, over 2000 miles. I had no friends, no family, no job, no transportation for the first 3 months besides him, so I was very lonely for a while and it made me feel even more isolated, sad, scared, and lonely. All not good for my mental health. I attempted to make friends with my boyfriend's best friends who were our roommates so I would feel less alone. \n\nI finally got a good job (making more than him), some friends from work, and a motorcycle. Our roommate J also has a motorcycle, and was the one who convinced me to get my lisence which has honestly made me the happiestive been in a while. I love my bike. I got him (J) a better paying job at where I work, and we would car pool to work together before I got my bike which lead to us spending lots of time together and doing things together on our off days bc they matched up. \n\nHe (J) is the one with the gf of 3 years and my boyfriend's best friend. He's totally loyal to her and 100% invested in her and only her and has not one but 2 rings to propose to her with. Here's the kicker, I have a massive crush on him. He is a majority of my good memories here if not almost all, he's handsome, caring, and honestly probably spent more time with me than my boyfriend has in the months I've been here. We've been mistaken for dating countless times, and when i was getting my bike from a dealership, the man thought we were together and married. \n\nI realized I had a crush on him when we were driving home at night on the freeway with the windows down, listening to Joji, and fireworks were going off bc it was the fourth of July (cheesy I know). I've very aware that this is extremely fucked up on my part and I beat myself up over it daily to the pointits really affecting my mental health even more. It's gotten to the point that it's making my anxiety and depression worse bc i feel like a terrible person. \n\nHe's honestly a tattooed \"bad boy\" and is conveniently my type, but I would NEVER cheat on my boyfriend. However, I feel like I'm emotionally cheating on him, and have no idea what to do ab my crush on our roommate and my bf's best friend. (I would NEVER hook up with him) \n\nJ has definitely called me out for \"fanfic-ing\" him (having lapses of judgment where I let it show on my face that I think he's doing something attractive, but don't say anything), and he relishes in the attention and gets giddy ab it and calls me out, but other than that we're just good friends. He eggs me on and makes flirtatious comments back, but I know he'd never jeopardize his realtionship either. He just likes the attention and affection, and I like the back and forth. I feel like it's totally harmless, but feel like I'm fucking over my bf.\n\nNeither of us would ever do anything to the other (both extremely loyal to our SO's), but I feel really bad ab having a crush on him and don't know what to do. I've been ignoring it for months, but I feel dirty, gross, and bad ab having a crush on him and i cant take it anymore.

I have not seen this side effect talked about very much online, and I would like to spread the truth about it. Not long after my first few doses of Zyrtec for seasonal allergies (I was 16 at the time), I began to get angry more often, and I'm not talking about mild irritability, I'm referring to explosive outbursts of anger. This transition from being mild mannered to agressive took my peers and those close to me by surprise. On top of that, I felt somewhat manic; I couldn't sleep and I barely ate. Just a side note, I had no history of mental illness before taking Zyrtec. It was only after I stopped taking it that these symptoms gradually dissapeared.

DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU WANT TO READ ABOUT MY CHILDHOOD AND TRAUMA  \n\n\nWhy I am a waste of space on this dying planet, and why I haven\u2019t done anything about it.\n\nFor a long time now, I have been what would be medically referred to as depressed. I have my moments of joy, but they quickly fade into the monotony of everything else. I have no friends, my parents and grandparents say they love me and care for me but I just can\u2019t accept it, and I\u2019m certain that my sister doesn\u2019t really like me. \n\nBesides that, my life is better than most people dream of. I have quite a bit of money, my college is paid for, I have all the latest technology, I get good grades, I\u2019m not severely disabled, I\u2019m a white-ish male, you couldn\u2019t even tell that I\u2019m not straight without knowing me, etc etc etc. \n\nUnfortunately, I did experience some mild childhood trauma. I was repeatedly punished (never physically) for small things, like leaving shoes too far into the hallway, or teasing my sister too much. I guess I was technically hit once when the tv remote was thrown at me because my parent was having a bad day and they couldn\u2019t get the remote to work and I couldn\u2019t describe to them how to make it work. I was also told a lot that I was \u201cdoing things for the attention\u201d and my mother would rephrase it like \u201cmaybe, somewhere subconsciously, you did want a little bit of attention\u201d and so I avoid attention as much as I can, but I also now desperately crave the attention of my peers, and when I don\u2019t get it, I feel like I\u2019m being lunched in the gut. I have trouble accepting that anybody could like me if they don\u2019t give me constant attention. Being ignored is like being trapped in a white void and even screaming wouldn\u2019t get me out. I believe that being told I was doing things for attention made me believe that, and so I started doing things for attention.\n\nAnother side effect of my childhood is that I lie constantly. My mother might ask \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d And I would respond \u201cgreat\u201d or \u201cok\u201d or \u201cpretty well\u201d even if I was miserable. I tell them that i always take my meds on time and every day, and I have even poured them down the toilet to avoid their disappointment at me not taking them. I once was two months  on my schoolwork, and the only way they found out was because one of my teachers mentioned that I hadn\u2019t been online in quite some time. That was the second time in the same year. I completely fabricate stories to tell my peers, but I also struggle with the actual details of my life, so it all kind of blends together. I like to myself when I take a picture of myself and say that it looks good; I do not look good. I am overweight, chubby, weak, dirty, and my parents constantly lie to me. I try not to eat, in hopes that I might lose weight, but then I go drink a soda to distract from my thoughts. \n\nI spend way too much time watching YouTube. It is a great way for me to get out of my own head, as I can just sit back and watch another person do things that I am incapable of. My reaction time is bad so I can\u2019t play many video games, I\u2019m not talented enough to write games so I watch dev logs, I\u2019m not capable of using tools so I watch people build stuff, and then I watch people getting into car accidents because at least I am not that unlucky. I watch a lot of fail videos, street fights, police chases, just straight up deaths, and other such things because it makes me feel like an asshole for thinking that my life was ever bad. \n\nI am now on the LGBTQIA+ floor, and everyone on it had to come out to their parent or parents, and I didn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t a big thing at all. Some of my peers were literally kicked out. I shouldn\u2019t have picked this hall because someone else more deserving of it could\u2019ve used the room. \n\nIn a lecture today, we were supposed to think of the last time we were supported, validated, or heard. I have never been heard because I have nothing special to say, I haven\u2019t been validated because I have nothing to validate, and support feels uncomfortable, stressful, and undeserved. That is what inspired me to spew this garbage out. \n\nNow, onto the other part of the title. \n\nBecause of my twisted need for people to be happy (another side effect of tiptoeing around an angry parent), I will not harm myself if only to keep my family from suffering through the grief of losing a child. I can imagine that my grandparents would not last much past my death, as they have told me multiple times that they are only really around for myself and my sister. Also, my parent, (not my mother but my father who transitioned) has tried so hard to make up for my childhood, and I think that if I died, she would follow suit. My mother would never be happy again, and my sister would be even more depressed and secluded. There is also the very much spoken responsibility that has been thrust onto me to \u201csave the world\u201d. When I was FOUR, yes four, my aunt was writing a book. My sister wanted to \u201cturn bad guys into dandelions\u201d, and I needed a thing. One of the elements of her book was that people could take a pill to live forever. I attached myself to that idea, and so did my family. Over the years, I have developed an affinity for using computers, and that strengthened this idea that I was somehow smart enough to design some kind of device to cure all aging and disease. In first grade, I did my first ever research project on DNA. I went to a university and asked a professor a few questions about the state of aging research. I was six years old. I was placed into the highly gifted program, and I skipped a grade. All of that convinced my family that I was going to do something great. Now, the current \u201cplan\u201d is to develop some form of nanobot cluster that is capable of navigating cells and repairing/modifying DNA. Every time I question my ability to do this, my parents get upset and tell me that I am \u201csuper smart\u201d. Also, every time I bring up my parents getting older, they always snap back with stuff like \u201cwell hopefully I won\u2019t ever have to have gray hair\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not planning on dying any time soon\u201d\u2026 They have told me that there is zero pressure to do anything and that they only want me to do what I feel is best for myself, but **they** have a vision for me, and telling them that I am not as special as they think I am and that I\u2019m okay with not being special would hurt them, therefore, I keep my mouth shut. I want so badly to just be able to flip a light switch and have my existence erased from history, with nobody knowing I ever existed, but that is not possible. Haha I used to bang my head against the wall to further punish myself when I would do something wrong, and I started seeing my first therapist because of that (I think). And no, it did not feel good to write this all down. I still feel like shit. Oh I went to the after party or my senior prom where I barely knew anyone, and I took a huge hit off of a bong. Very bad idea, I was crying on the couch for a while, I never want to experience that total lack of control again, but there was a point after the awfulness dissipated where I didn\u2019t care about anything, and that was the last and only time I didn\u2019t go over every possible scenario in my head, or worry about how annoying I was, or have some song constantly rattling through my brain like some noisy neighbor. Yes, it was illegal, but that was the way of the high school I went to, I guess. Oh that reminds me, I constantly have to fight my thoughts because they\u2019re often times awful \u201cyes this is the right time to die! Right over that railing, it would be so fast and then you\u2019d stop worrying\u201d or occasionally it will be super fucking racist and I\u2019ll feel like a piece of shit for that \u201cvoice\u201d even saying the shit it does. I actively have to maintain order within my brain, but luckily, I have a really good ability to mask everything I\u2019m thinking or feeling. People see what I want them to, when I want them to. That comes from having to mask my own thoughts so damn much. I guess I\u2019m like a chameleon, I change my personality to somewhat match the person I\u2019m taking to, and I say \u201cidk\u201d to everyone I don\u2019t know in fear of having dissonant opinions. I do have my own moral compass and beliefs, but they sometimes take the back burner to the beliefs of the person I\u2019m talking to. I have even noticed that my accent changes depending on the person I\u2019m talking to. I guess the term for that is a people pleaser. oh and when I do something that makes people look at me for whatever reason, I don\u2019t just feel embarrassment, I feel shame, remorse, and fear that they\u2019ll remember my error. \n\nOk I\u2019m done for now.\n\nSat, August 27.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~", "author_fullname": "t2_lf93t78q", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "A note I wrote an hour ago while feeling like shit, I just want it to exist somewhere.

That was the second time in the same year. I completely fabricate stories to tell my peers, but I also struggle with the actual details of my life, so it all kind of blends together. I like to myself when I take a picture of myself and say that it looks good; I do not look good. I am overweight, chubby, weak, dirty, and my parents constantly lie to me. I try not to eat, in hopes that I might lose weight, but then I go drink a soda to distract from my thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spend way too much time watching YouTube. It is a great way for me to get out of my own head, as I can just sit back and watch another person do things that I am incapable of. My reaction time is bad so I can\u2019t play many video games, I\u2019m not talented enough to write games so I watch dev logs, I\u2019m not capable of using tools so I watch people build stuff, and then I watch people getting into car accidents because at least I am not that unlucky. I watch a lot of fail videos, street fights, police chases, just straight up deaths, and other such things because it makes me feel like an asshole for thinking that my life was ever bad. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am now on the LGBTQIA+ floor, and everyone on it had to come out to their parent or parents, and I didn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t a big thing at all. Some of my peers were literally kicked out. I shouldn\u2019t have picked this hall because someone else more deserving of it could\u2019ve used the room. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a lecture today, we were supposed to think of the last time we were supported, validated, or heard. I have never been heard because I have nothing special to say, I haven\u2019t been validated because I have nothing to validate, and support feels uncomfortable, stressful, and undeserved. That is what inspired me to spew this garbage out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, onto the other part of the title. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because of my twisted need for people to be happy (another side effect of tiptoeing around an angry parent), I will not harm myself if only to keep my family from suffering through the grief of losing a child. I can imagine that my grandparents would not last much past my death, as they have told me multiple times that they are only really around for myself and my sister. Also, my parent, (not my mother but my father who transitioned) has tried so hard to make up for my childhood, and I think that if I died, she would follow suit. My mother would never be happy again, and my sister would be even more depressed and secluded. There is also the very much spoken responsibility that has been thrust onto me to \u201csave the world\u201d. When I was FOUR, yes four, my aunt was writing a book. My sister wanted to \u201cturn bad guys into dandelions\u201d, and I needed a thing. One of the elements of her book was that people could take a pill to live forever. I attached myself to that idea, and so did my family. Over the years, I have developed an affinity for using computers, and that strengthened this idea that I was somehow smart enough to design some kind of device to cure all aging and disease. In first grade, I did my first ever research project on DNA. I went to a university and asked a professor a few questions about the state of aging research. I was six years old. I was placed into the highly gifted program, and I skipped a grade. All of that convinced my family that I was going to do something great. Now, the current \u201cplan\u201d is to develop some form of nanobot cluster that is capable of navigating cells and repairing/modifying DNA. Every time I question my ability to do this, my parents get upset and tell me that I am \u201csuper smart\u201d. Also, every time I bring up my parents getting older, they always snap back with stuff like \u201cwell hopefully I won\u2019t ever have to have gray hair\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not planning on dying any time soon\u201d\u2026 They have told me that there is zero pressure to do anything and that they only want me to do what I feel is best for myself, but &lt;strong&gt;they&lt;/strong&gt; have a vision for me, and telling them that I am not as special as they think I am and that I\u2019m okay with not being special would hurt them, therefore, I keep my mouth shut. I want so badly to just be able to flip a light switch and have my existence erased from history, with nobody knowing I ever existed, but that is not possible. Haha I used to bang my head against the wall to further punish myself when I would do something wrong, and I started seeing my first therapist because of that (I think). And no, it did not feel good to write this all down. I still feel like shit. Oh I went to the after party or my senior prom where I barely knew anyone, and I took a huge hit off of a bong. Very bad idea, I was crying on the couch for a while, I never want to experience that total lack of control again, but there was a point after the awfulness dissipated where I didn\u2019t care about anything, and that was the last and only time I didn\u2019t go over every possible scenario in my head, or worry about how annoying I was, or have some song constantly rattling through my brain like some noisy neighbor. Yes, it was illegal, but that was the way of the high school I went to, I guess. Oh that reminds me, I constantly have to fight my thoughts because they\u2019re often times awful \u201cyes this is the right time to die! Right over that railing, it would be so fast and then you\u2019d stop worrying\u201d or occasionally it will be super fucking racist and I\u2019ll feel like a piece of shit for that \u201cvoice\u201d even saying the shit it does. I actively have to maintain order within my brain, but luckily, I have a really good ability to mask everything I\u2019m thinking or feeling. People see what I want them to, when I want them to. That comes from having to mask my own thoughts so damn much. I guess I\u2019m like a chameleon, I change my personality to somewhat match the person I\u2019m taking to, and I say \u201cidk\u201d to everyone I don\u2019t know in fear of having dissonant opinions. I do have my own moral compass and beliefs, but they sometimes take the back burner to the beliefs of the person I\u2019m talking to. I have even noticed that my accent changes depending on the person I\u2019m talking to. I guess the term for that is a people pleaser. oh and when I do something that makes people look at me for whatever reason, I don\u2019t just feel embarrassment, I feel shame, remorse, and fear that they\u2019ll remember my error. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok I\u2019m done for now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sat, August 27.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": true, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "wzer3a", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Responsible_Main_443", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 3, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/wzer3a/a_note_i_wrote_an_hour_ago_while_feeling_like/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wzer3a/a_note_i_wrote_an_hour_ago_while_feeling_like/", "subreddit_subscribers": 927660, "created_utc": 1661637766.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext": "im 18 years old right now and since i was 12 i have had awful ocd. when i was 14 i went through the wrong puberty and realized i was trans at 15. i just came out to my family at 18 and they were very kind but they said things such as \u201cyou can\u2019t feel a gender\u201d, \u201ctrans people didn\u2019t exist 15 years ago\u201d, \u201ci wanted long hair at your age too\u201d, \u201ci hated puberty too\u201d. it crushed me. they think i\u2019m just a feminine gay boy and i was ready to take hormones and now they are having me question everything. one of my family members said \u201ci\u2019m scared of how society will treat you\u201d and i said \u201ci don\u2019t care, it won\u2019t bug me\u201d and she said \u201cit will\u201d. i think these ignorant fast comments are awful and critical to someone with ocd. i\u2019m now obsessing over wether i\u2019d be able to transition or wether i\u2019m even trans because of them.\n\n my family has always been so good to me, and that\u2019s why i feel awful being depressed. i feel because people have it worse than me that i shouldn\u2019t be suicidal. my mom did apologize and she cried to me saying they should have listened to me and it\u2019s a lot for her to process. i continued to try to explain and she still just wrote it off as i\u2019m a feminine gay boy. my heart hurts. this was all after the night i ran out to my friends car with a bag packed and called my mom explaining to her that i needed time away and i was temporarily moving out because no one was understanding me and i started questioning everything. she cried saying please come home and my dad texted me saying \u201cdon\u2019t do this to your mother\u201d. i still feel fucking stuck being in my childhood room.\n\nin conclusion, i feel nothing due to my ocd, dysphoria, and depression. i feel immense guilt for being depressed when there\u2019s people coming out getting fully abandoned by there families. i\u2019m tired, i\u2019m numb, and i haven\u2019t felt anything in so long, and i don\u2019t know if i ever will again. i\u2019m trapped in the wrong body, i have no purpose, i am addicted to my phone and i\u2019m a terrible human. i just want to be ok. but here i am, a beautiful house, beautiful family, amazing friends, a cute dog, yet STILL i waist all my time on my phone and complain on the negatives?

Experience has shown that my mental health will not get better, therefore I won&amp;#39;t ever be in a position to make a decent living, and not making a livable amount of money increases the stress, depression, and anxiety I experience. Both problems feed into each other and there doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be a way to fix either. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m at the end of my rope here.
