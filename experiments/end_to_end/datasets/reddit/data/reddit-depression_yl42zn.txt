On Saturday night, October 29, I dressed in a masked costume to walk around campus, nearby strips, and most frequently, Greek parties because it was Halloween weekend. I dressed this way to get some good scares and compliments in, and I succeeded, but I also wanted to not miss out on these aforementioned parties. Now, throughout this time, I wore the mask 95% of the time and hardly ever took it off because it was breathable.\n\nMy goals for that night were these:\n\n\\-Get as much harmless scares as you can with your costume\n\n\\-Make a girl compliment you and maybe fall for your costume due to the mystery surrounding you\n\n\\-Get as much compliments on your costume as possible\n\n\\-Go to as much Halloween events as you can find to not miss out because you only have a year left\n\nI first went to a house party a student organization was holding to talk to people, and everyone there was friendly throughout the entire time I was there. I paid the cover and got some good jumpscares in and they laughed afterward. It was very relaxed and I even had some roasted marshmallows. Now, I have to point out that it was relaxed because it was filled with people I've known before. I left around 45-50 minutes later to head to the greek houses to see if there was any parties going on and to get some more scares and compliments in.\n\nNow, this is where things took a turn. I went to the first fraternity house that had a crowd. However, they didn't want me in even though they were \"too full\" even though those sexist assholes blatantly let any girl they saw in. I tried to convince them otherwise and even let them know about this, but I failed and they told me to \"get the fuck out.\"\n\nThe second fraternity house was across the street from the first one, and fortunately, I was able to pay my way in with $20. I had fun and got some good scares and compliments in like before, but I could hear the song \"closing time\" through the speakers around 12:30am. I thought nothing of it, and just went outside and stood next to a window the on the front lawn because that's where the crowd was heading out to. I got some more scares/compliments, but I was told by another asshole fraternity member that I needed to once again \"Get the fuck off \\[his\\] lawn.\" I was off the lawn and stood on the curb, he didn't even want me standing on there and tried pushing me off. Looking back on that interaction, I understood why he wanted me and so many others out, but I didn't need to be pushed out of the lawn itself. I could've just stayed on the lawn until I left, but I walked away further into the greek house area.\n\nA little further into the night, I found my final fraternity house and luckily paid another $20 to get in. I saw there was still a good crowd in the basement and decided to go in. I had some more fun and got some more compliments, even from a couple girls. I thought one of them might have been turned on by my costume. However, I was noticed by this one motherfucker who was part of a completely different fraternity than the house we were in, so he didn't even have any jurisdiction or authority to kick me out. Regardless, I explained to him that I paid to get in, but he didn't listen. Nonetheless, he was bigger and taller than me, so he decided to forcefully push me out. He bruised my arm pretty hard against a metal door as he pushed me from behind, and there's still a blue mark on there a little bigger than a golf ball. Once I was outside, I tried to lean myself against a nearby car to get my bearings, but I was pushed once again from behind by the same guy, almost falling over on the concrete. When I was walking away slowly and looked back at the pusher, I could hear him laughing and taunting me saying he could kick my ass. All while another guy kept him restrained and calmly told me to go. I could tell the pusher was intoxicated, but all I said to the guy holding him back was to \"take care of your friend\" and walked away with a bruised arm and feeling mad and upset for being kicked out without any justification. I thought about going in through the back door, but I didn't want to get my ass kicked any further, so I left.\n\nI soon walked to the nearby strip, where the most crowded bars were, and made a few laps there, getting some more scares and compliments. This was while the mask hid my pained and crying face from earlier. I then sat down somewhere secluded to think about what it took to try to not miss out on so many events and gain better favor with fraternities. Another goal I had that night was to make friends wherever I could, and not make anyone hostile, but what harm did I do to them? I didn't deserve to get kicked out. I just wanted to have fun, but those motherfuckers made it so much worse. I found a bus stop and headed home at around 2am. I put some cold water on the bruise and just went to bed in physical and emotional pain. The question I ultimately wanted to ask someone is that why can't fraternities be more inclusive and less hostile? Looking back on things, I really should've stayed at the first event at the cost of missing other potential events.\n\nI feel depressed after this because it feels like no one wants me around anymore because the events two days ago made me feel more wary of others' intentions, even if they don't know it's me. I also feel down because I know they would want to hurt me if I ever go near their houses again, mask or not.

On Saturday night, October 29, I dressed in a masked costume to walk around campus, nearby strips, and most frequently, Greek parties because it was Halloween weekend. I dressed this way to get some good scares and compliments in, and I succeeded, but I also wanted to not miss out on these aforementioned parties. Now, throughout this time, I wore the mask 95% of the time and hardly ever took it off because it was breathable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My goals for that night were these:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Get as much harmless scares as you can with your costume&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Make a girl compliment you and maybe fall for your costume due to the mystery surrounding you&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Get as much compliments on your costume as possible&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Go to as much Halloween events as you can find to not miss out because you only have a year left&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I first went to a house party a student organization was holding to talk to people, and everyone there was friendly throughout the entire time I was there. I paid the cover and got some good jumpscares in and they laughed afterward. It was very relaxed and I even had some roasted marshmallows. Now, I have to point out that it was relaxed because it was filled with people I&amp;#39;ve known before. I left around 45-50 minutes later to head to the greek houses to see if there was any parties going on and to get some more scares and compliments in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, this is where things took a turn. I went to the first fraternity house that had a crowd. However, they didn&amp;#39;t want me in even though they were &amp;quot;too full&amp;quot; even though those sexist assholes blatantly let any girl they saw in. I tried to convince them otherwise and even let them know about this, but I failed and they told me to &amp;quot;get the fuck out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second fraternity house was across the street from the first one, and fortunately, I was able to pay my way in with $20. I had fun and got some good scares and compliments in like before, but I could hear the song &amp;quot;closing time&amp;quot; through the speakers around 12:30am. I thought nothing of it, and just went outside and stood next to a window the on the front lawn because that&amp;#39;s where the crowd was heading out to. I got some more scares/compliments, but I was told by another asshole fraternity member that I needed to once again &amp;quot;Get the fuck off [his] lawn.&amp;quot; I was off the lawn and stood on the curb, he didn&amp;#39;t even want me standing on there and tried pushing me off. Looking back on that interaction, I understood why he wanted me and so many others out, but I didn&amp;#39;t need to be pushed out of the lawn itself. I could&amp;#39;ve just stayed on the lawn until I left, but I walked away further into the greek house area.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A little further into the night, I found my final fraternity house and luckily paid another $20 to get in. I saw there was still a good crowd in the basement and decided to go in. I had some more fun and got some more compliments, even from a couple girls. I thought one of them might have been turned on by my costume. However, I was noticed by this one motherfucker who was part of a completely different fraternity than the house we were in, so he didn&amp;#39;t even have any jurisdiction or authority to kick me out. Regardless, I explained to him that I paid to get in, but he didn&amp;#39;t listen. Nonetheless, he was bigger and taller than me, so he decided to forcefully push me out. He bruised my arm pretty hard against a metal door as he pushed me from behind, and there&amp;#39;s still a blue mark on there a little bigger than a golf ball. Once I was outside, I tried to lean myself against a nearby car to get my bearings, but I was pushed once again from behind by the same guy, almost falling over on the concrete. When I was walking away slowly and looked back at the pusher, I could hear him laughing and taunting me saying he could kick my ass. All while another guy kept him restrained and calmly told me to go. I could tell the pusher was intoxicated, but all I said to the guy holding him back was to &amp;quot;take care of your friend&amp;quot; and walked away with a bruised arm and feeling mad and upset for being kicked out without any justification. I thought about going in through the back door, but I didn&amp;#39;t want to get my ass kicked any further, so I left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I soon walked to the nearby strip, where the most crowded bars were, and made a few laps there, getting some more scares and compliments. This was while the mask hid my pained and crying face from earlier. I then sat down somewhere secluded to think about what it took to try to not miss out on so many events and gain better favor with fraternities. Another goal I had that night was to make friends wherever I could, and not make anyone hostile, but what harm did I do to them? I didn&amp;#39;t deserve to get kicked out. I just wanted to have fun, but those motherfuckers made it so much worse. I found a bus stop and headed home at around 2am. I put some cold water on the bruise and just went to bed in physical and emotional pain. The question I ultimately wanted to ask someone is that why can&amp;#39;t fraternities be more inclusive and less hostile? Looking back on things, I really should&amp;#39;ve stayed at the first event at the cost of missing other potential events.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel depressed after this because it feels like no one wants me around anymore because the events two days ago made me feel more wary of others&amp;#39; intentions, even if they don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s me. I also feel down because I know they would want to hurt me if I ever go near their houses again, mask or not. Right now, I just feel helpless, scared, and unable to do anything because I feel like everyone now is either put off by me or actively trying to make me suffer. It honestly feels like there&amp;#39;s nobody in the college I can trust.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry if I don&amp;#39;t make any sense in my post, but this is something I just wanted to get off my chest.

I am currently on meds for mild, yet very persistent depression and sadly I keep on having bad luck (bad reactions) with new meds ever since the old ones simply stopped having an effect at max dosage (escitalopram). Anyway, I've been curious to hear your thoughts on using CBD oil for depression, anxiety (which I seem to have as well now) and sleeping problems (severe sleeping problems since I am 15 and have been prescribed benzos to deal with them which I take scarcely nowadays, due to difficult side effects). Is it truly a \"miracle\" drug as people make it out to be? I've smoked weed before for 5 months which helped my sleep to an extent which was beyond my wildest imagination but sadly it made my anxiety worse, and so I decided to stop with it and try a THC free/low alternative for all three problems. Anybody has some experience with something similar and is willing to share?

I talked with my parents about it and they suggested a therapist but i felt that i couldn\u2019t even describe my feelings to them so i didn\u2019t n\u2019t go to any of them. But i was feeling better\u2026 happier!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now we are here. I am feeling empty again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t feel happiness in anything anymore like im used to anymore. Football isn\u2019t giving me the excitement it is used to me anymore. My friends are great don\u2019t get me wrong, but i still feel empty after meeting them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nowadays i don\u2019t feel any desire or motivation to complete things. It\u2019s gone as far to the point that im afraid to check what I need to study for my tests for my upcoming exams because i feel scared and unprepared already.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like i have become depressed again. I don\u2019t like the word because i feel like i don\u2019t have the right to be a cry baby because a lot of people have it a lot worse than me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But still i do feel depressed.. i think..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me.\nI don\u2019t expect you to know the answers to my problems but it kinda feels nice to share it, even if you are all strangers :).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ps: my first language isn\u2019t English so sorry for any typos.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "yg5id6", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Fit-Combination8937", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/yg5id6/i_dont_feel_happiness_anymore/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/yg5id6/i_dont_feel_happiness_anymore/", "subreddit_subscribers": 927660, "created_utc": 1667004411.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext": "I\u2019m on mobile so I\u2019m sorry for any formatting issues I just really felt the need to share my feelings somewhere\n\nI\u2019ve been suicidal since I was 14 (25 now) and as messed up as it sounds the validation that comes from the concern my loved ones showed for me was one of my main reasons for sticking around if not the only one.

I Really need help, someone to talk, I Want to live, but it&amp;#39;s too Hard, but I don&amp;#39;t wanna die, but is like a war in my head, it feels awful, Please, someone help me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "y9azlt", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "OkAd666", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/y9azlt/will_it_be_easier_if_i_just_die/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/y9azlt/will_it_be_easier_if_i_just_die/", "subreddit_subscribers": 927660, "created_utc": 1666302377.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext": "Hey everyone, I want to understand depression more.

Then figured it would be something for special occasions. So 3 days after the trip I had a complete mental breakdown, missing work, freaking out that I\u2019m 21 and don\u2019t have my life figured out, constantly researching careers and colleges, even enrolled in a community college (yay)\n\n\n once I enrolled and began to calm down I had the rest of the summer ahead of me. I would go to my grandparents pool every weekend with my dad and girlfriend, from about June 18th- July 3rd I didn\u2019t smoke any cigars. I began smoking them again about every other day. My anxiety completely faded away and for possibly the first time since I was a child I felt I was living in the moment. Rest of my summer was great, working, relaxing and watching tv with my dad at night. I slowly started realizing the things I was doing that I wasn\u2019t capable of before when my anxiety was at its peak.\n\nSummer went by the fastest I remember it in my life. It\u2019s time for our week vacation we take in September, the 24th this year. I guess now I\u2019ve been smoking about 3 cigars a week and I\u2019m feeling great mentally, thriving at work, looking forward to starting school, happy with my gf. I\u2019m down the shore relaxing with family and I get from my grandfather \u201cyou\u2019re on vacation, who cares if you smoke 5 cigars a day?\u201d So that I did (or close to it) wake up have a cigar, eat lunch have a cigar, go down to the beach have a cigar on the beach, get back from the beach eat dinner  and have a cigar, then sit out with my buddy and have a cigar before bed.\n\n\n The week ends and I\u2019ve consistently smoked 3-5 a day the whole week. We get home October 1st, take a nap, eat dinner then smoke a cigar. The next day one more cigar. Today is the 5th and I haven\u2019t smoked since the second. I am almost the most depressed I have ever been in my life, I had to stay home from work, I have no appetite (other than when I wake up in the middle of the night and eat, cause I\u2019m hungry) I\u2019m having constant panic attacks and similarly to June I have found the focus of my anxiety\u2026 time. What\u2019s the point of doing anything when it just ends, summer went so quick so now it\u2019ll be new years before we know it, oh wow how could this (pictures, texts etc.) have been 6 months ago, a year ago, 183 days ago yada yada. I\u2019m so depressed I don\u2019t feel like showering, shaving, eating or talking to anyone besides my family and gf. \n\nMy question is. Is it the cigars/nicotine that\u2019s making me feel like this? Can going from 3-5 cigars a day to none for 4 days make me feel like this? Is that what did it back in June? The withdrawals of 1-2 cigars a day for a week and a half to 0 cigars for 2-3 weeks? I am on anti depressants, I upped them in June because the depression. I just want answers. Can I ever smoke cigars again? Just don\u2019t over do it? Should I let all the nicotine out of my system before I smoke another on occasion? Can the nicotine/withdrawal be what\u2019s making me so depressed I can\u2019t function? It\u2019s too coincidental that after both vacations, smoking cigars and then stopping/ cutting down. I\u2019ve had the worst depression of my life.\n\nI just want to know if nicotine withdrawal (if that\u2019s what it is)  causes this\u2026 hopelessness, hyper fixation, depression, lethargy?", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4k5qnf", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Is it what\u2019s making me depressed?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_xwufc5", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1665025448.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.depression", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So back in June on vacation I started smoking cigars, just a hobby while on vacation, maybe 1-2 a day, 3 maybe one of the days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got home from that vacation, unpacked, and lit up one more cigar with my friend. Then figured it would be something for special occasions. So 3 days after the trip I had a complete mental breakdown, missing work, freaking out that I\u2019m 21 and don\u2019t have my life figured out, constantly researching careers and colleges, even enrolled in a community college (yay)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;once I enrolled and began to calm down I had the rest of the summer ahead of me. I would go to my grandparents pool every weekend with my dad and girlfriend, from about June 18th- July 3rd I didn\u2019t smoke any cigars. I began smoking them again about every other day. My anxiety completely faded away and for possibly the first time since I was a child I felt I was living in the moment. Rest of my summer was great, working, relaxing and watching tv with my dad at night. I slowly started realizing the things I was doing that I wasn\u2019t capable of before when my anxiety was at its peak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summer went by the fastest I remember it in my life. It\u2019s time for our week vacation we take in September, the 24th this year. I guess now I\u2019ve been smoking about 3 cigars a week and I\u2019m feeling great mentally, thriving at work, looking forward to starting school, happy with my gf. I\u2019m down the shore relaxing with family and I get from my grandfather \u201cyou\u2019re on vacation, who cares if you smoke 5 cigars a day?\u201d So that I did (or close to it) wake up have a cigar, eat lunch have a cigar, go down to the beach have a cigar on the beach, get back from the beach eat dinner  and have a cigar, then sit out with my buddy and have a cigar before bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The week ends and I\u2019ve consistently smoked 3-5 a day the whole week. We get home October 1st, take a nap, eat dinner then smoke a cigar. The next day one more cigar. Today is the 5th and I haven\u2019t smoked since the second. I am almost the most depressed I have ever been in my life, I had to stay home from work, I have no appetite (other than when I wake up in the middle of the night and eat, cause I\u2019m hungry) I\u2019m having constant panic attacks and similarly to June I have found the focus of my anxiety\u2026 time. What\u2019s the point of doing anything when it just ends, summer went so quick so now it\u2019ll be new years before we know it, oh wow how could this (pictures, texts etc.) have been 6 months ago, a year ago, 183 days ago yada yada. I\u2019m so depressed I don\u2019t feel like showering, shaving, eating or talking to anyone besides my family and gf. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My question is. Is it the cigars/nicotine that\u2019s making me feel like this? Can going from 3-5 cigars a day to none for 4 days make me feel like this? Is that what did it back in June? The withdrawals of 1-2 cigars a day for a week and a half to 0 cigars for 2-3 weeks? I am on anti depressants, I upped them in June because the depression. I just want answers. Can I ever smoke cigars again? Just don\u2019t over do it? Should I let all the nicotine out of my system before I smoke another on occasion?

She's been hospitalized for depression 7 times. She's diagnosed with depression and autism. She suspects she has borderline personality disorder but can't find a psychiatrist who wants to hang that label on someone so young. Also if you want to see therapists and practitioners flee mention borderline.\n\nMy kid is in a bad place. She had a bad breakup and oscillates between blaming him and herself. Needs to grieve that relationship. She is switching meds to lithium and I'm not sure it's working. She broke down at work two days in a row and they said to go home and they \"we will call you in a week\". She doesn't have her high school friends around and she didn't move on to college.\n\nShe wants to die, is severely depressed, and if she develops a plan I would lock her up involuntarily. It's appropriate right now.\n\nI've struggled with depression and manic depression on my own. I rode depressive realism all the way down to psychotic depression. Eventually I found the right meds for myself. I found the right lifestyle and support. I learned about the [cognitive distortions of depressive thinking](https://psychcentral.com/depression/cognitive-distortions-the-lies-depression-tells#types-in-depression) and eventually stopped myself from thinking that way.\n\nI'm not a success story or an intrinsically optimistic person but I keep my head above water.\n\nBecause of this I can't stand listening to her. It's all cognitive distortions and the errors from it. Errors compounded on bad conclusions. I can't begin to politely correct that. I want to scream that what she is saying is bullshit but I know screaming would not help nor would setting up a strong opposition. I don't scream but I am pissed. I'm not a great listener.

She&amp;#39;s been hospitalized for depression 7 times. She&amp;#39;s diagnosed with depression and autism. She suspects she has borderline personality disorder but can&amp;#39;t find a psychiatrist who wants to hang that label on someone so young. Also if you want to see therapists and practitioners flee mention borderline.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My kid is in a bad place. She had a bad breakup and oscillates between blaming him and herself. Needs to grieve that relationship. She is switching meds to lithium and I&amp;#39;m not sure it&amp;#39;s working. She broke down at work two days in a row and they said to go home and they &amp;quot;we will call you in a week&amp;quot;. She doesn&amp;#39;t have her high school friends around and she didn&amp;#39;t move on to college.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She wants to die, is severely depressed, and if she develops a plan I would lock her up involuntarily. It&amp;#39;s appropriate right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve struggled with depression and manic depression on my own. I rode depressive realism all the way down to psychotic depression. Eventually I found the right meds for myself. I found the right lifestyle and support. I learned about the &lt;a href=\"https://psychcentral.com/depression/cognitive-distortions-the-lies-depression-tells#types-in-depression\"&gt;cognitive distortions of depressive thinking&lt;/a&gt; and eventually stopped myself from thinking that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not a success story or an intrinsically optimistic person but I keep my head above water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because of this I can&amp;#39;t stand listening to her. It&amp;#39;s all cognitive distortions and the errors from it. Errors compounded on bad conclusions. I can&amp;#39;t begin to politely correct that. I want to scream that what she is saying is bullshit but I know screaming would not help nor would setting up a strong opposition. I don&amp;#39;t scream but I am pissed. I&amp;#39;m not a great listener.
