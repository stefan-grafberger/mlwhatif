Because of peer pressure. We are all affected by it, after all it is human nature to try and imitate other people in order to be more likable. We have a deep desire to fit in, to not be the odd man out. Anyone who says peer pressure does not affect them are either hard capping, being defensive, lying to themselves to not hurt their ego or are just unaware of it.\n\n2. It is a way for them to relax, let go and become more social. I just rage inside when I hear this one. Why on earth would people deliberately put their health on the line for such a short term benefit. If this is the reason you drink, then you openly admit that you do not have enough confidence in yourself and your ability to socialise. You depend on a substance to provide you with confidence and social skills. You go out with friends to have a good time, but realise that the only thing connecting you to these \"friends\" is alcohol. Your entire friendship is built on a substance.\n\n\n\nI know I will face alot of hate saying this, but the only way to overcome this is to toughen up. Stop acting like a little kid. You drink because of peer pressure, but what you do not realise is that going against peer pressure may be hard but it makes you stand out, it may decrease your likeability but it will increase the respect people give you. You will show people that you have beliefs that do not change based on other people, that you stand for what you believe in, which for me is caring more about my health and well being than about what other people think of me. You drink to be more social, but what you do not realise is that by doing this you are actively telling yourself that you are not good enough. Instead of drinking, you can challenge yourself to go out and improve your social skills, without the need of some intoxicant substance.\n\nWhat you will notice when you first quit drinking is that you will also lose the friends you used to go out and drink with, but this just further shows how stupid the friendship was in the first place. You might start feeling lonely which in my eyes is a good thing since this will force you to have more time with yourself and seek new healthier friendships with likeminded people.\n\n\nBut after all I'm just a teenager who was fortunate enough to not face pressure to drink until I was old enough to know better.

You drink to be more social, but what you do not realise is that by doing this you are actively telling yourself that you are not good enough. Instead of drinking, you can challenge yourself to go out and improve your social skills, without the need of some intoxicant substance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What you will notice when you first quit drinking is that you will also lose the friends you used to go out and drink with, but this just further shows how stupid the friendship was in the first place. You might start feeling lonely which in my eyes is a good thing since this will force you to have more time with yourself and seek new healthier friendships with likeminded people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But after all I&amp;#39;m just a teenager who was fortunate enough to not face pressure to drink until I was old enough to know better. So I cannot completely relate with the struggle people face. Hopefully I managed to inspire some of you guys to at least consider trying to quit drinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmbm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "rt1pbg", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Imran_btw", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 34, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfimprovement/comments/rt1pbg/alcohol_is_stupid/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/rt1pbg/alcohol_is_stupid/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1352066, "created_utc": 1640980038.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfimprovement", "selftext": "(18M) I failed NNN after 5 days\u2026 I\u2019m disappointed in myself but 5 days is the longest I\u2019ve gone without masturbation so I\u2019m just hoping I can get further next time!", "author_fullname": "t2_kbxililf", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "No Nut November", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/selfimprovement", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_ynnht4", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 111, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Other", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 111, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1667733910.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.selfimprovement", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;(18M) I failed NNN after 5 days\u2026 I\u2019m disappointed in myself but 5 days is the longest I\u2019ve gone without masturbation so I\u2019m just hoping I can get further next time!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "daf40582-1e96-11ed-a26c-aad6fb65f35d", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmbm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "id": "ynnht4", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SamDavies320", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 103, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfimprovement/comments/ynnht4/no_nut_november/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/ynnht4/no_nut_november/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1352066, "created_utc": 1667733910.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfimprovement", "selftext": "So I see a lot of people who are angry because they don't live as they want.

Stop watching porno.\n\r\nWhen we are watching porn, we are literally telling our brain that we are about to have sex with the opposite gender then after you bust a nut your brain will come back to reality and you realize (subconsciously) that you don\u2019t have a chick. This will decrease your confidence overtime and you end up feeling like a loser. I've been there. Porn destroys confidence. You won\u2019t be able to hold up a conversation with no chick because you see her as an object that only exist for sex. You won\u2019t be able to hold eye contact with anyone (not even family members). This was a short explanation on why porn is bad for confidence but I might make a story later going in more details.\r\n\r\nTip #2. Take more risks/ talk to more people\r\n\nMost of us are introverts, We don\u2019t like to talk to people. But there is a lot of benefits to talking to people and one of it is..... you guessed it right. You get more confidence. When you take the risk of going to talk to that girl. Even if she rejects you, you will feel more confidence. Isnt it crazy. Its a win win situation. But most of us are scared of rejection and we overthink things. Me included. We are in this together. It starts with the little things. Lets say you\u2019re in your room and some family member come visit. Don't stay in the room and ignore them. Go outside, greet them with a big smile. It will make you feel better and by doing that. It will put you in a better position when faced with situations like that (when someone come and talks to you unexpected). Take the risk or lose the chance.  \r\n\r\nTip #3 workout more\n\r\nYes, this is a common thing people say but it's true. You got to do some hardcore workouts at least 5 times per week. Don't just go to the gym and do some bicep curls and pushups and thing you\u2019re going to get better. Those won\u2019t get you anywhere. Get on a program you made for yourself and go life some heavyweight. Do some jiu jitsu and boxing. By doing this. You will increase your confidence significantly.\r\nTip #4 talk positive to yourself\r\nNow talking positively to yourself is something everyone tells you to do but we often get confused with negative talks and pushing our self. When I don\u2019t feel like training my mind tells me I'm worthless and until I workout my mind won\u2019t stop making me feel guilty. Some people may say that\u2019s negative self-talk but it's not. It's you pushing you. Negative self-talk is like you saying that you\u2019re fat asf and can\u2019t get laid so you don\u2019t do nothing about it. Pushing yourself is saying I'm fat asf and shit can\u2019t stay like this. See the difference? Push yourself but never talk negative to yourself because you are all you got. Love yourself.\n \r\nTip #5 do what you told yourself you would do\n\r\nThis is a big one because if you tell yourself you\u2019re going to do something and you end up not doing it, you will start to doubt yourself. You won\u2019t believe in yourself. To have confidence you have to believe in yourself. Don\u2019t procrastinate things. Once you say you\u2019re going to do something, DO it. If you say you\u2019re going to clean your room. CLEAN IT. If you say you\u2019re going to talk to the girl then TALK TO HER. You got nothing to lose by talking to her. If you get rejected then its fine. You still gained confidence. If you get accepted then fine you got extra confidence.  when you believe in yourself. you will give out a different type of energy. You will start to walk different, talk different, dress different. Girls/ boys will start to feel it and you become more attractive\n \r\nExtra tip: stop listening to rappers rapping about fcking bad chicks and popping pills.\n\r\n Its ok to listen to it when you\u2019re with friends and you dance or sing but don\u2019t listen to those rubbish when you\u2019re alone because there's going to be a point where you actually start believing those stuff you sing and you actually want to start doing those things and trust me.

webinar.\n\nI thought I might finally be able to claim my own life, but I'm still stuck, no closer to having my own life, and I just don't want to go through anymore.\n\nI just turned 26, caught the fucking virus RIGHT before losing my parents health insurance, and for all I know my joke of an employer might try and deny me the health insurance I signed up for because I got sick and infected RIGHT before the end of the year, I was afraid I'd get this stupid virus right before the end of the year when I lose my guaranteed and free health insurance (I also take multiple meds on a daily basis for the past 10 years, I can't function without them, one is an SSRI and I'd rather die than suffer the withdrawal from that).\n\nI don't want to spend more years of my life trying to start a successful business, I don't want to go to school for 4+ years to MAYBE be able to get a decent job afterwards (when I'll be in my fucking 30s), and I don't want to go through another year of being abused by customers, managers, being seen as less than human doing meaningless labor and barely paid $350 a week for it, what a fucking joke.\n\nI hate this fucking society, I hate American capitalism, I hate this fucking world. \n\nI can't go through another year bagging groceries and pushing carts, I don't want to be in ANY retail environment AT ALL, none of them treat or pay their employees right, they all suck. I can't go through mood swings from having to take so many goddamn pills all the time, and being dismissed as \"imagining it\" or \"making it up\" or \"exaggerating\" (DOCTORS DO THIS TOO).\n\nI can't go through another year of being the awkward older guy working around a bunch of teenagers, can't drive a fucking car because of PTSD and constant road rage, inability to have a girlfriend or lose virginity, and just inability to get a decent job/source of income (fuck Mike Vestil and his BS passive income SCAM) so I can start and live my own fucking life.\n\nSociety is BROKEN, it is RIGGED, everyone is overruled and exploited by the 1% ELITIST BASTARDS. \n\nMy parents continue to tell me I'm wrong or being ridiculous until realizing how ignorant they were and that I'm not as stupid as they act like I am, finally took me being sick seriously when I got an actual positive COVID test, and now my employer is making it hard to get the pay they're supposed to give infected employees. I don't even know if they're going to let me have my health insurance now, I can't just stop taking Sertraline, Oxcarbazepine (been on them for 10 YEARS) and Bupropion SR (which has gotten my ubncontrollable rage outbursts under control, PREVENTING ME FROM KILLING SOMEONE IT WAS GETTING THAT BAD BEFORE I TOOK THAT).\n\nI just get older and older, my youth was a waste, it was meaningless, and I didn't really get to enjoy it at all.\n\nI'm sick of stupid ignorant idiots telling me to just \"man up\" or \"grow the fuck up\" or any of that \"tough love\" BS, it does nothing but make me want to hurt them, or myself more.\n\nI just get older and older, and nothing really changes, I hate the fucking real world, I do not belong in modern society,  and it just gets harder and harder to change anything.\n\nIf I try to go back to school, I have to work less, but I have to work more to keep that health insurance, and I have to pay more for Uber to get there, but I'll make less from working less, and if I just do it at home, that's just continuing my life of isolation and it is mentally terrifying (severely worse from fever dreams like being sick right now).\n\nI can't even enjoy the little things anymore, like watching YouTube, playing games, watching shows, because reality is getting closer, time isn't slowing down at all, I'm not getting any younger.\n\nI just keep getting older and still get no closer to being able to start live, live on my own, have my own place, have a girlfriend, have sex, I couldn't even travel the goddamn world without \"getting rich quick\" (those other things don't require that, but require being able to live on my own, and even making a LIVING INCOME can't be gotten quick).\n\nEven SLOW AND STEADY success, isn't guaranteed, but that's still depressing because I didn't get to enjoy any of my youth, not even my goddamn 20s, which are almost over, and most certainly will be by the time I could realistically achieve  any type of success, financial or otherwise. \n\nMoney does matter, it's how we're literally able to live, and there's an excess of jobs which pay FAR BELOW even a BASIC living wage, and inflation is only getting worse.\n\nSo many people ARE working from home, supposedly for more than these crap jobs, but I still don't know what they're doing or how to get into it.\n\nIt seems there really is no genuine legitimate way to get rich quick, and the quickest thing you can achieve is an income that can't even cover rent and bills, it's all a goddamn joke.\n\nI'm not 18, or 21, I'm 26 now, I missed out on everything, I'm expected to be past it all, but I never lived any of it, and I don't even know how to get into life FROM THIS POINT.\n\nI just don't get it.", "author_fullname": "t2_cev8g2t3",

If you are a fan of Hamza, I recommend not reading this you will probably get your feelings hurt or attack me so now let's begin. First of all, he is definitely a narcissist some of his older videos were really inspiring and I personally loved them he got me into meditating and gratitude journaling and that helps but over time I felt like all of the subscribers got to him he got so entitled and thought he was so better or the leader of a pack or cult which I think shows subconsciously something is wrong with his self-esteem but idk. Also can we talk about how he says video games are terrible personally me I do not play video games but it is stupid to say you can't play video games  or if you do you are a Jeffrey it's like every time someone criticizes him he backlashes at them because he can't take criticism but back to video games I think he is projecting his experience of video games in which he could not balance his life properly and ended up failing classes is kind of dumb because you are you and your experiences and your life aren't a cookie cutter shape anyone can put in but ofc sometimes playing video games is bad as you must do everything in moderation so evaluate to yourself not just in video games in anything you do in life is this affecting my social academic or financial life negatively if yes then maybe you should do a dopamine detox if no then your fine everything in your life has to be moderated and  your needs are not defined by some guy on the internet.

This might be somewhat odd but I'm going to format the rest of this as a Q&amp;A section and I would kindly ask for some input on my situation. Thanks!\n\n**What Is A NEET?**\n\nNEET stands for Not in Employment, Education, or Training. In Japanese culture the word \"Hikikomori\" is used but they both refer to the same thing. Most NEETS live at home with their parents.\n\n**How Long Have You Been A NEET?**\n\nI graduated High School five years ago and have been a NEET for 4.5 out of those 5 years. I spent about three months taking part time courses as well as three months working in retail over those five years. \n\n**How Do You Spend Your Time?**\n\nSince finishing high school I've spent my time doing a lot of the same things I did while still in school, just more then ever before. That mainly includes watching YouTube, playing video games, and going on Reddit. I've also been a guitarist for almost a decade so I've been practicing that but not consistently. There are other things I've taken an interest in on and off over the years like coding, running, and reading. None of these are things I've stuck with for long periods of time.  \n\n**Why Are You A NEET?**\n\nThe reason I'm a NEET is because I have no desire to go back to school, get a job, or contribute to society. I'm also afraid of giving up too much of my free time. Unfortunately this leads me to my main dilemma. The path I'm currently on is guaranteed to end with me being a 30+ year old moneyless, friendless, virgin with no life experiences or independence. Obviously this scares me and I feel like I'll be full of regrets if I spend the rest of my 20s as a NEET. At the same time I hate the idea pursuing some stressful degree or getting some 40+ hour per week job. I'm also severely mentally ill but I'll cover that separately. \n\n**Who Supports Your Lifestyle?**\n\nMy parents pay for all my basic expenses. They are also willing to pay for things like a new phone, laptop, etc... every few years. I grew up lower middle class and still exist in that category. My parents have made it clear that they would rather I have my own income and life but that they would never kick me out or do anything to punish me for the lifestyle I have chosen. It probably costs around $5000 per year extra to support me which is a lot less compared to if they were paying for me to have my own place, and all the expenses that come along with that. \n\n**How Long Can You Remain A NEET?**\n\nAs far as I'm aware I could remain a NEET for the foreseeable future. Financially my parents can afford the extra $5000 per year it costs to support me even on their pension, as they are both retired. One of my parents works part-time but even without that we could still survive. The worrying part is that my parents are both in their mid to late 60s. I still believe that I could remain a NEET for the next 20+ years if I wanted to. I may end up inheriting a house which would obviously help a lot but the odds of that are about 50/50. Like I mentioned in the other answer my parents would never be willing to kick me out but they would rather I do something with my life. My extended family has made their disappointment in my NEET lifestyle clear but they're not the one's supporting me. \n\n**What Mental Health Issues Do You Have?**\n\nAt this point I have a long list of severe mental health issues with all of them being the worst in the last two years. I basically can't function at all anymore, and I can't bring myself to do many of the things I once enjoyed. I was diagnosed with ADHD in my late childhood and spent about five years on Adderall. Starting in Highschool I developed a bunch of issues relating to anxiety with chronic overthinking as the main symptom. I also started developing what I think is obsessive compulsive disorder which would take too long to do into right now. I gradually started spending more and more time in my own head, completely loosing the ability to exist in the present moment. The issues have only gotten progressively worse over the last seven years to the point where I can't function at all. I also went through an existential crisis in 2020 which I feel changed me as a person permanently. These days I overthink every little thing to the point where I can't bring myself to even play a video game or watch a movie because there would be too many things to think about and too many decisions to make even for something simple.\n\n**What Is Your Goal With Posting This?**\n\nI'm simply looking for advice. I've already mentioned the dilemma I'm in but basically I'm scared of ending up being a middle aged man with no friends or life experiences, especially romantic ones. I don't feel like I can fix one aspect of my life without tackling things in a more holistic way. As an example I don't think I could convince my parents to pay thousands of dollars for therapy sessions unless I'm actively working to get the other parts of my life in check. I'm not sure it would even be worth it considering not having any kind of routine and not keeping busy probably contribute to my mental health issues. Along with having no desire to study or work I'm also afraid of going out of my comfort zone and doing things that scare me. Learning how to drive is an example. I'm not as bothered when my parents drive me around but the thought of controlling a car on the road terrifies me. Anyway, any advice would be appreciated, thanks! \n\nTL;DR - I've been a NEET for a vast majority of the last five years since finishing High School. I'm afraid of ending up as a 30+ year old moneyless, friendless, virgin with no life experiences but I also have never had any desire to go to school, work, or contribute to society in any way. On top of that I'm afraid of giving up too much of my leisure time which seems extremely likely if I go back to school or work full-time. My parents would rather I become my own person but they are also willing and able to cover my food and housing costs for the foreseeable future. The one worrisome part is that they are both in their mid to late 60s so that's something to factor in. I may end up inheriting a house eventually but the odds of that are about 50/50. It's not too late to change things around but I feel I'm at the point where I have to commit to either sticking with the NEET life for the long term or forcing myself to change my life around. I also have a long list of mental health issues that have been getting progressively worse for the last seven years to the point where I can't bring myself to do many of the things I used to enjoy. Even though it wouldn't be an instant fix I feel like having a routine and keeping busy would somewhat help with all my issues.

Let me explain\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve spent over 1,000 hours studying life through direct experience. (That\u2019s living with Zen monks and 5 years of mindfulness meditation practice.)\n\nThe most important lesson learned is what I call \u201c**the infinite possibility of every interaction**\u201d.\n\nThis means in each moment \u2013 even the seemingly trivial or unimportant ones \u2013 there\u2019s an entire ocean of possibility right under your nose.

In each moment you might knock over a domino that leads to a serious of life changing dots \u2013 that you only connect later on.\n\nI\u2019ve experienced this many times \u2013 from little things like getting a surprise Mustang GT (we\u2019ll get there) to bigger things like falling love or majoring in happiness.\n\nEach of these started with **a small encounter \u2013 a moment of potential energy \u2013 that changed the trajectory of my life.**\n\nBut if you\u2019re still reading this, you probably want to hear about this damn mustang. So let me tell you.\n\nLast month I flew to Alabama to visit my alma mater. I got to the counter to pick up my rental car. As you can imagine, the rental agent wasn\u2019t overly energized sitting in the parking garage at 10PM on a Wednesday.\n\nAt this point I had a sort of \u2018mindful moment\u2019: I thought - why not try to fully engage with the person across from me and create a positive interaction? So I remembered to smile and share my energy.\n\n**Sidebar \u2013 in every interaction you either add or subtract energy. A good rule for life is to try always give more energy than you take!**\n\nWe got to talking and she asked me if I was here on business. So I teased her a bit and said I could make something up if there was a good reason. She said sometimes for business travel they have a chance to upgrade your rental.\n\nI said \u2013 \u201cwell I\u2019d like to hear about that, what can we do?\u201d. She punched some stuff in and said it ends up being about the same price.\n\nLet\u2019s do it\u2026\n\nI walk out back to where I was supposed to pick up my Nissan Ultima and I find a bright red, soft top Mustang GT.\n\n**Holy sh\\*\\*!**\n\nI told her\u2013 \u201cyou know you might not get this back in one piece! I\u2019m gonna die this weekend\u2026\u201d\n\nI ripped that thing down to my friend\u2019s house and \u2013 we\u2019ll put it this way \u2013 got my money\u2019s worth over the next few days.\n\nThis bright spot of amazing luck led to so much fun and so many good memories. And it all connected back to one little, seemingly trivial interaction.\n\nTalking to the rental agent is nothing special. And that\u2019s the point. **Every moment has infinite potential energy and possibility. Every person is a universe of experience each their own. And every interaction could be a new lifelong friend, future spouse, or cherished memory.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;As Thich Nhat Hanh said \u2013 \u201cif you live in awareness, it is easy to see miracles everywhere.\u201d\n\nThe power of mindfulness is increasing your capacity to bring this awareness to each moment.

Assertiveness is not yelling, screaming, or insulting of others.

For example, a girlfriend steps over one your boundaries, you sit her down and have a long talk with her about it. Loving but stern.\n\nBut if she violates your boundaries over and over, YOU MUST BE WILLING TO LEAVE. For example, I don't put up with yelling, screaming, or insults in my relationship. If a girl is upset, she should be able to tell me \"when need to talk\", sit me down, and then explain, in a mature adult-like fashion, why she's upset. She can cry or feel angry, but in a mature, adult-like fashion.\n\nBut if instead, whenever she gets upset about something she continues to immediately jump to conclusions, starts screaming insults at me, and starts breaking and smashing stuff, then I leave.

I still consider it important but it's up to you.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo for the explanation, I was born hard of hearing. Because of that, I've always struggled to make conversations with people as I often didn't understoodd them. Over the years, I became uncomfortable when surrounded by strangers, I'm even paranoid sometimes when I hear laughs behind me. I also stutter and often avoid to talk because of that.\n\nI also spent most of my childhood alone. I never had any friends which I felt I could trust except one who had psychological difficulties (Similar to an \"intermittent explosive disorder\" according to Google, I never knew what he truly had), he was socially misunderstood pretty much like I was and I think that's why we got along well. Outside school, I was completely alone except when playing online games, or talking on reddit-like websites with people the same age as mine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause of that lonely childhood, I felt in depression many times and tried to kill myself once. I had appointments with psychologists for around 7-8 years in total (I'm 24), and also had more than enough time to develop what can definitely be considered as troubled points of view about the world I live in and the people around me.\n\nOne exemple could be me thinking I belonged to the neo-nazi movement. I was amazed by the unity of the national-socialist people in every image, video and movies about them. See them being prouf of who they were made me feel stronger by \"joining\" them. I started to despise the same religion they did. It lasted for a couple years until I just felt bored by it and stopped. To be clear, I wasn't praising the nazi values nor was I actively despising jewish people because of that. It was only a way of thinking when I felt bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\------\n\nNow for the main question and the reason why I created this thread.\n\nTo make it simple to understand to everyone, I feel much more uncomfortable when I am surrounded by people of colors than when I am with white people. I am not interested in them, I do not find their face morphology pretty, and the color of their skin repels me.\n\nI have no clue why I think like that at all. But I believe the main reason of all that is due to the fact I never got used to be surrounded by people of color as most people did. As dumb as it might sound, I don't see any other explanation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first psychologist I saw was a person of color. Because of that fact alone, even if he was nice to me I never was able to truthfully open myself to him. I just pretended I was going better for a while and stop seeing him. Couple monthes go by, I get depressed &amp; have suicidal toughts again, this time however I had a white psychologist so it went well.\n\nI also once had a black \"friend\" in school (By \"friend\" I mean someone with whom I spent time with just to feel less alone, it was the same for everyone regardless of their color). We were often doing classroom stuff together, he was nice too, but I think I didn't bonded with him as much as I did with the other guy (the one with troubles) because of his skin color. (Altough I was more comfortable with him than I was with the white \"friends\" that just were there to not feel alone).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall, I don't really think I feel hate towards people of color. I'm 100% certain I am not a white supremacist, as it is a way of thinking I dont tolerate having. I'll admit that I feel people of different colors shouldn't mix together as we lose some of our ethnic identity by doing so, but if this is what they want I'm definitely not going to stop them from doing so.\n\nOverall I'm just a lot less comfortable being next to them (in the bus or the train for example) than I am with white people. I don't see myself marrying someone of color neither. I don't know why, it's just been that way as long as I can remember.\n\nIf that may help me feel less like a p\\*ece of shit, I have absolutely no problem with people of religion.  I have also no problem with homosexuality, pansexuality or anything like that (Altough I don't like the LGBT movement as I often find it too extreme, much like the r/fuckcars subreddit). I was raised by a lesbian couple, and have no problem with talking about it at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's all I can think of for now..\n\n\\----------------------\n\n(Thanks in advance if you made it there.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo. To you, am I racist ? (If not, what would describe me best) ?\n\nI know I could/should make a **TLDR** for the lazy people, but I'm not an english native and I don't want to make any false impressions (good or bad) or simply be misunderstood. It is already tough to summarize my past in a couple lines, doing so in a couple sentences would only make things worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, what could I do to \"fix\" that wrong point of view I've had for more than 10 years ? I believe that's the point of this subreddit to help people improving themselves, I'd like to get rid of that bad side of me but I just don't know how.\n\n(I'll answer any of your questions truthfully if clarifications or details are required.)", "author_fullname": "t2_7uaz8fgo", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "I feel uncomfortable with people of color.

Over the years, I became uncomfortable when surrounded by strangers, I&amp;#39;m even paranoid sometimes when I hear laughs behind me. I also stutter and often avoid to talk because of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also spent most of my childhood alone. I never had any friends which I felt I could trust except one who had psychological difficulties (Similar to an &amp;quot;intermittent explosive disorder&amp;quot; according to Google, I never knew what he truly had), he was socially misunderstood pretty much like I was and I think that&amp;#39;s why we got along well. Outside school, I was completely alone except when playing online games, or talking on reddit-like websites with people the same age as mine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because of that lonely childhood, I felt in depression many times and tried to kill myself once. I had appointments with psychologists for around 7-8 years in total (I&amp;#39;m 24), and also had more than enough time to develop what can definitely be considered as troubled points of view about the world I live in and the people around me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One exemple could be me thinking I belonged to the neo-nazi movement. I was amazed by the unity of the national-socialist people in every image, video and movies about them. See them being prouf of who they were made me feel stronger by &amp;quot;joining&amp;quot; them. I started to despise the same religion they did. It lasted for a couple years until I just felt bored by it and stopped. To be clear, I wasn&amp;#39;t praising the nazi values nor was I actively despising jewish people because of that. It was only a way of thinking when I felt bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now for the main question and the reason why I created this thread.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To make it simple to understand to everyone, I feel much more uncomfortable when I am surrounded by people of colors than when I am with white people. I am not interested in them, I do not find their face morphology pretty, and the color of their skin repels me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no clue why I think like that at all. But I believe the main reason of all that is due to the fact I never got used to be surrounded by people of color as most people did. As dumb as it might sound, I don&amp;#39;t see any other explanation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first psychologist I saw was a person of color. Because of that fact alone, even if he was nice to me I never was able to truthfully open myself to him. I just pretended I was going better for a while and stop seeing him. Couple monthes go by, I get depressed &amp;amp; have suicidal toughts again, this time however I had a white psychologist so it went well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also once had a black &amp;quot;friend&amp;quot; in school (By &amp;quot;friend&amp;quot; I mean someone with whom I spent time with just to feel less alone, it was the same for everyone regardless of their color). We were often doing classroom stuff together, he was nice too, but I think I didn&amp;#39;t bonded with him as much as I did with the other guy (the one with troubles) because of his skin color. (Altough I was more comfortable with him than I was with the white &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; that just were there to not feel alone).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, I don&amp;#39;t really think I feel hate towards people of color. I&amp;#39;m 100% certain I am not a white supremacist, as it is a way of thinking I dont tolerate having. I&amp;#39;ll admit that I feel people of different colors shouldn&amp;#39;t mix together as we lose some of our ethnic identity by doing so, but if this is what they want I&amp;#39;m definitely not going to stop them from doing so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall I&amp;#39;m just a lot less comfortable being next to them (in the bus or the train for example) than I am with white people. I don&amp;#39;t see myself marrying someone of color neither. I don&amp;#39;t know why, it&amp;#39;s just been that way as long as I can remember.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If that may help me feel less like a p*ece of shit, I have absolutely no problem with people of religion.  I have also no problem with homosexuality, pansexuality or anything like that (Altough I don&amp;#39;t like the LGBT movement as I often find it too extreme, much like the &lt;a href=\"/r/fuckcars\"&gt;r/fuckcars&lt;/a&gt; subreddit). I was raised by a lesbian couple, and have no problem with talking about it at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all I can think of for now..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;----------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Thanks in advance if you made it there.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So. To you, am I racist ? (If not, what would describe me best) ?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know I could/should make a &lt;strong&gt;TLDR&lt;/strong&gt; for the lazy people, but I&amp;#39;m not an english native and I don&amp;#39;t want to make any false impressions (good or bad) or simply be misunderstood. It is already tough to summarize my past in a couple lines, doing so in a couple sentences would only make things worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, what could I do to &amp;quot;fix&amp;quot; that wrong point of view I&amp;#39;ve had for more than 10 years ? I believe that&amp;#39;s the point of this subreddit to help people improving themselves, I&amp;#39;d like to get rid of that bad side of me but I just don&amp;#39;t know how.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(I&amp;#39;ll answer any of your questions truthfully if clarifications or details are required.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmbm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "up6voc", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PainfulSuccess", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 11, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfimprovement/comments/up6voc/i_feel_uncomfortable_with_people_of_color_does/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/up6voc/i_feel_uncomfortable_with_people_of_color_does/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1352066, "created_utc": 1652493179.0, "num_crossposts": 1, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfimprovement", "selftext": "I recently moved to LA to pursue my tech career.

Working out/dieting isn't going to get rid of my gynecomastia, make me taller than 6 ft (I'm 5'9\") or make my face attractive enough. I know it'll slim my face down, but that's it - it's not going to change my nose shape, my forehead, etc. Also, my genetics probably aren't even that good compared to other people's. At it's just too much work for what to me, are little benefits. Like I have to be in the presence of other people miles more attractive and capable than me on a regular basis just to still be less attractive and capable than them?

Asian male. Single. Ex-SWE\n\nDuring the peak of the 2021, I became a millionaire. I went all in with my 300k on TSLA in beginning of 2020, and it ended up shoot up to 1.5mil at the peak. Overnight, I became a millionaire without doing much other than clicking a few things in my browser. That gave me confidence. That gave me thinking that I am the shit. I quit my job since I actually never liked SWE, and said I'm gonna do my on thing. I started dabbling in crypto and put majority of my winnings there.\n\nThen it dropped by 60% during the recent crashes. I still had around 400k in crypto, and I basically stopped trading at a point and put all of that into USDC. Only that it was all in FTX and now I can't draw them out.\n\nI don't know what's gonna happen, but right now I'm sitting at 10k liquid in my bank. I thought I was a confidence millionaire, and all the sudden things went upside down.\n\nThis is scary. All the sudden, things just went to 0. Everything I had worked for suddenly came crumbling down.\n\nSo I went from being a confident millionaire to a terrified crybaby. I don't know what's gonna happen, but this is where I am now.\n\nEverything -- gone, just like that.\n\nI wanna say im fine, but its slowly settling in on me.\n\nBut someone dawned on me. A realization. An epiphany.\n\nThe way I had been going with my life is entirely backwards. I viewed money as important, but in the end it isn't. When I became a millionaire, I thought it'd be world changing. It isn't. I wasn't any different, but having the lottery money gave me some confidence, and I ran with it. But now, gone with the crashes of 2022. I'm now jobless, savingless, and the prospects for finding a SWE job seems daunting amongst layoffs.\n\nIt just showed me how wrong I've been living life. Completely backwards. I never liked SWE and just did it for the money. With that money I invested into stocks and crypto, and did well. With that money, I upgrade my life, my tastes, etc. But deep down I wasn't happy nor fulfilled.\n\nThis all made me realize that I've been building my life on sand, and it's all been an illusion. Money, better life, upgrades, all these external things are just an illusion. Why was I chasing after all these? How did I end up in this mess?\n\nAnd, for the first time in a long time, I prayed. Surrendering myself, and prayed.\n\nAnd strangely enough, I don't feel so bad anymore.\n\nAll these external things -- chasing after money, luxury, materialism -- really don't mean much anymore. These are the wrong metrics to evaluate my life. And letting these go, freed me from the weight of thinking about them.\n\nFrom now, the metric I go by is how much I am helping others with my heart and skills. Doing this really makes me feel fulfilled.\n\nI have recently been dabbling with creators, and I completed a writing cohort and I've been helping out here and there. I feel very alive and fulfilled doing so.\n\nSo now I want to measure myself by how much I am helping others, building the **social credit or goodwill**, as the currency. I am going to give more than I take. I'm letting go of the obsession w/ money, and instead of focusing on helping ppl with my unique talents.\n\nI am not scared of my future, because I know this new path is a more fulfilling one to embark on. A new chapter begins.\n\n\\---\n\nIf you are impacted by these market meltdowns, i hope this message finds you and may be of help for you.
