When I was 12 I told a girl I had a crush on her and she rejected me in front of my whole class and she chased the popular guy right in front me. The girls who know me say I&amp;#39;m a great guy and they complain that there are no good men out here but they never give me a chance. Instead, they just go for the hot guys and fuckboys.

I want to walk people through this as I just can't really contain my excitement, so I want to rant. I'm confident you'll learn a thing or two. \n\nThe Dopamine Detox lifestyle is cutting out the vast majority of instant gratification, replacing it with delayed gratification activities that give you long-term happiness through genuine accomplishment. \n\n\\-----\n\n**We can say that the majority of instant gratification activities are the ones that give us an instant happiness boost right now, but do not contribute to our long-term happiness or progress.** When you have that bite of ice-cream, the pleasure disappears as soon as you swallow. When you spend hours on social media, the pleasure comes and goes as quick as you can swipe your thumb, dissipating as soon as you turn the screen off. These activities do not help us. \n\n**Delayed gratification activities are the activities that may actually make us feel less motivated to do them, almost dread. However, once you start and especially complete them, you'll feel a sense of accomplishment that comes from a genuine place, re-enforcing your confidence through capability and giving you long-term happiness should you be consistent.** This is getting up at a consistent time every morning, meditating, journaling, cold showers, hygiene routine, dressing up for the day, eating clean and meal prepping, showing up to your workplace and doing the work, or being your own boss and doing the work needed to accelerate your business growth, its going to the gym and working on building your aesthetic physique. \n\n\\-----\n\n**I've seen so many people make these excuses for why they do bad habits. They'll throw buzzwords around like \"moderation\", \"just one more\", \"a few times per week\", \"Oh its been a while\", \"Oh I did well I'll treat myself.\"** \n\nWe don't NEED the vast majority of what we are hooked to in the modern world these days. You don't NEED to treat yourself to that ice-cream, not once per week, not once per month. Never. You don't need it to survive, so why can't you change your mind to be truly grateful for the healthy food you put into your body??? Whether it is through professional help, self improvement techniques, or both, you can live life to its fullest without a single bean of junk food and be completely okay.

I&amp;#39;m confident you&amp;#39;ll learn a thing or two. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Dopamine Detox lifestyle is cutting out the vast majority of instant gratification, replacing it with delayed gratification activities that give you long-term happiness through genuine accomplishment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-----&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We can say that the majority of instant gratification activities are the ones that give us an instant happiness boost right now, but do not contribute to our long-term happiness or progress.&lt;/strong&gt; When you have that bite of ice-cream, the pleasure disappears as soon as you swallow. When you spend hours on social media, the pleasure comes and goes as quick as you can swipe your thumb, dissipating as soon as you turn the screen off. These activities do not help us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delayed gratification activities are the activities that may actually make us feel less motivated to do them, almost dread. However, once you start and especially complete them, you&amp;#39;ll feel a sense of accomplishment that comes from a genuine place, re-enforcing your confidence through capability and giving you long-term happiness should you be consistent.&lt;/strong&gt; This is getting up at a consistent time every morning, meditating, journaling, cold showers, hygiene routine, dressing up for the day, eating clean and meal prepping, showing up to your workplace and doing the work, or being your own boss and doing the work needed to accelerate your business growth, its going to the gym and working on building your aesthetic physique. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-----&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen so many people make these excuses for why they do bad habits.

You don&amp;#39;t NEED to treat yourself to that ice-cream, not once per week, not once per month. Never. You don&amp;#39;t need it to survive, so why can&amp;#39;t you change your mind to be truly grateful for the healthy food you put into your body??? Whether it is through professional help, self improvement techniques, or both, you can live life to its fullest without a single bean of junk food and be completely okay.

Then shut the f  up.\u00a0\u00bb&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also said that reading books instead of binging Netflix was much better for critical thinking and problem solving and all they could come up with is:\u00a0\u00ab\u00a0im not a damn philosopher I don\u2019t need these skills\u00a0\u00bb or \u00ab\u00a0you don\u2019t even read books dumb*ss\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0(ps I do actually)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically what I learned from this is that some people are Blue Pill Jeffereys and aren\u2019t willing to see their own flaws, and that trying to change their mind is pointless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will from now on never converse with them about self improvement, I\u2019ll just be on my own grinding, following my dreams of Adonis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Woah, reading these comments was an experience. Thank you all for you feedback, I learned a lot. I realised that I probably have an ego issue and will work on it.

Addiction to porn starts in your mind, in the very thoughts that you have. The techniques above distract your thoughts rather than remove them. That\u2019s the problem that I have with it.\n\nMisconception number two, once you\u2019ve overcome porn you cannot fall back into it.\n\nThis is completely wrong.\n\nAnyone who has overcome an addiction can fall back into it at any time or find something else to destroy their life with.

Even the smallest and most innocent of thoughts or curiosity is all it takes to have a snowball effect and ultimately destroy your progress\n\nI can confidently say that I have overcome porn, but every day I also keep overcoming it. Every day I am exposed to our immodest society where certain images or scenes might enter my mind but I fight to keep them out. No matter where you go, there is always going to be danger. Influencing your thoughts is one thing, but others can influence it too.\n\nThis is why you have to be extremely cautious of not only regulating the thoughts in your mind, but also the thoughts others may try to plant in your mind. The \u201cothers\u201d that I am mentioning can be as simple as peers or as innocent as a picture in front of a store that sells sensual products. Even a movie or TV show can cause you to think about a particular scene or play.\n\nI\u2019m a fairly religious Muslim, so take my next point as you want. The only way to completely be safe from all sin is to attain the Soul at Peace. That is the ultimate objective that we have to aim for, there is no nobler objective than being among ranks of God\u2019s beloved.

The theory was developed by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his book \u201cThe Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable\u201d.\n\nOne of the most important takeaways from this theory is that you should not rely on past events to predict future ones.\n\nThis means that you should not be overconfident in your predictions and always have a backup plan just in case something goes wrong.\n\n### How to Implement the Black Swans in Your Daily Life\n\nBlack swans are events that are out of the ordinary and happen with low probability. They can have a huge impact on your life. They can be positive or negative, but they are always unpredictable.\n\nThe best way to implement the black swans in your daily life is to prepare for them. You should always be prepared for unexpected events and keep an open mind when faced with something you don't know anything about.\n\n### The Importance of Not Having Expectations in Life and Remembering that Anything Can Happen Life is full of surprises and it is important to be mindful of that.\n\nIf we go into a situation with expectations, we are setting ourselves up for disappointment. We also need to remember that anything can happen in life and not just what we expect.\n\nA good way to avoid disappointment and be mindful of surprises is to not have any expectations.\n\nYou can't know what will happen or what will be in your path without an expectation. If you don't have expectations, you can't become overly upset when something unexpected happens.\n\n### How Black Swans Make Our Lives More Interesting\n\nThe term \u201cblack swan\u201d is used to describe an event that is a surprise and has a major impact. \n\nThe term was originally used to describe the European discovery of Australian black swans.\n\nIt was assumed that all swans were white, so the discovery of these black ones came as a surprise. \n\nBlack swan theory makes our lives more interesting by increasing the range of possibilities in life and making it less predictable for others.\n\n### What are some Disadvantages of the Black Swan Theory?\n\n1.People underestimate risks due to the fact that they are not aware of all-the-possible outcomes\n\n2.It can lead to a false sense of security\n\n3.It can cause people to make irrational decisions\n\n### The Value of Negative Thinking in Improving Your Life\n\nNegative thinking is not always a bad thing. It is actually a healthy and necessary process for many people.\n\nNegative thinking can be defined as the thoughts we have about ourselves, other people, and the world in general that are negative or pessimistic. This includes thoughts like I\u2019m not good enough or I\u2019ll never succeed.\n\nNegative thinkers often have an easier time seeing the potential pitfalls of something before they happen rather than just expecting everything to work out perfectly every time. This can help them avoid making mistakes or getting into trouble in certain situations.\n\n### 5 Reasons Why You Should Stick to Black Swan Theory at Your Life Sometimes\n\n1. It Helps with Improving Your Situation\n\n2. It's Easier to Adjust Your Course When There are Fewer Variables\n\n3. You Will Learn More from Mistakes if You Have a Fewer Options\n\n4. You won't be stuck in a rut if you don't plan too much ahead of time.\n\n5. It Helps You Take Decisions on \"gut Feel\"\n\n### The Value of Negative Thinking &amp; How it Makes You More Resilient\n\nWhat hit the nails that having more than backup realistic plan at life, will put you step ahead to conditional or unconditional events easily.\n\nNo one will dare to manipulate you as your actions aren't perceptive, which tends to more valuable, resilient state and character along the way.", "author_fullname": "t2_pnk9p468", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "why you should stick to black swan theory at your life sometimes?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/selfimprovement", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_yapa4p", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Question", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "spoiler", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1666449070.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.selfimprovement", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is the Black Swan Theory?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Black Swan Theory is a theory used to describe events that are deemed improbable yet have a significant impact on the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The theory was developed by Nassim Nicholas Taleb and is based on the idea that events with extreme consequences are often not well-predicted because they are perceived as too unlikely to occur. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Why You Should Stick To The Black Swan Theory in Life Sometimes&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Black Swan Theory is a metaphor for the improbable event that is difficult to predict, and has a dramatic effect.

I just want to provide some context. I'm South Indian. I grew up in a household where no alcohol/drugs were tolerated. I never made a racist remark before this incident. I started in January 2022 instead of August 2021 because I was diagnosed with a neurotoxic version of bulbar palsy.\n\nBasically the few months before January I was kind of out mentally. Many of the symptoms I had were aligned to ALS(a terminal Neuromuscular disease), and at the time I didn't have an objective diagnosis. From August 2021 to March 2022 I basically thought I was dying. So from August to December I just talked to my HS friends who were in college. They told me how fun it was and crazy it was. People would drink and go crazy at parties. I got really sad because I thought I could never experience this.\n\nWell then January hits and I have a choice to go to college. I'm still in the neurologic diagnostic process but I take the chance and I'm assigned with a few other roommates. The college I go to is pretty conservative and only 40 percent of the school is non-white. My roommates held parties basically twice a week and there was alcohol/weed involved. I drank 9 shots of whiskey my 2nd time drinking. I got super drunk and I'm a people pleaser. There was like 20 people total and they were all white. So I started rambling about how white people are so cool because they party and stuff. The next statement I made was ignorant, racist, and disrespectful. Literally all of my friend group back in HS was Asian. I would say even close to 90 percent. I proceeded to say that Asians are boring because all they do is game and study. And I always gamed with my friends and have had great moments with them in orchestra and tennis. We even fished and had many great memories in HS/MS. But with my remark I threw all of them under the bus just to please people I barely even knew for 2 weeks. I generalized billions of people with one statement and called them boring. Is this what I've learned the past 19 years of my life? To be racist and fucking ignorant? To think that I even said that made me fucking angry. And to say that in the midst of the COVID pandemic makes it even worse as Asian people have been disrespected so much.\n\nThe next day I took a drug(weed gummy) for the first time ever. I was still going through health issues. My main symptoms were trouble swallowing, continuous muscle spasms, and stiffness. So me without thinking just accepted a gummy and ate it to fit in with my roommates. It was completely my fault that I took it. I would say 30 minutes after taking it my neuromuscular symptoms worsened dramatically. My spasms increased dramatically and started constricting my chest wall. My dysphagia(trouble swallowing) got way worse and I couldn't drink. I eventually had a hard time breathing. Everyone just started looking at me and honestly they didn't try to help. But I can't blame them because if I went to the ER and said I took a drug there might've been a chance that they could've been busted. And I don't want to get people in trouble for an action I took. I then called my Asian friends who have always been there for me. I told them that I took weed. I started telling them how I was a disappointment and failure because I took a drug. For the next hour they talked to me and encouraged me so much. They were there for me at my lowest and the day before I just threw them under the bus.\n\nAfter that incident I changed rooms and got a room for myself. I basically didn't interact with anyone outside of schoolwork.\n\nIt's been 8 months since them. Should I tell my Asian friends that I made that statement? How do I improve?

I just want to provide some context. I&amp;#39;m South Indian. I grew up in a household where no alcohol/drugs were tolerated. I never made a racist remark before this incident. I started in January 2022 instead of August 2021 because I was diagnosed with a neurotoxic version of bulbar palsy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically the few months before January I was kind of out mentally. Many of the symptoms I had were aligned to ALS(a terminal Neuromuscular disease), and at the time I didn&amp;#39;t have an objective diagnosis. From August 2021 to March 2022 I basically thought I was dying. So from August to December I just talked to my HS friends who were in college. They told me how fun it was and crazy it was. People would drink and go crazy at parties. I got really sad because I thought I could never experience this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well then January hits and I have a choice to go to college. I&amp;#39;m still in the neurologic diagnostic process but I take the chance and I&amp;#39;m assigned with a few other roommates. The college I go to is pretty conservative and only 40 percent of the school is non-white. My roommates held parties basically twice a week and there was alcohol/weed involved. I drank 9 shots of whiskey my 2nd time drinking. I got super drunk and I&amp;#39;m a people pleaser. There was like 20 people total and they were all white. So I started rambling about how white people are so cool because they party and stuff. The next statement I made was ignorant, racist, and disrespectful. Literally all of my friend group back in HS was Asian. I would say even close to 90 percent. I proceeded to say that Asians are boring because all they do is game and study. And I always gamed with my friends and have had great moments with them in orchestra and tennis. We even fished and had many great memories in HS/MS. But with my remark I threw all of them under the bus just to please people I barely even knew for 2 weeks. I generalized billions of people with one statement and called them boring. Is this what I&amp;#39;ve learned the past 19 years of my life? To be racist and fucking ignorant? To think that I even said that made me fucking angry. And to say that in the midst of the COVID pandemic makes it even worse as Asian people have been disrespected so much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day I took a drug(weed gummy) for the first time ever. I was still going through health issues. My main symptoms were trouble swallowing, continuous muscle spasms, and stiffness. So me without thinking just accepted a gummy and ate it to fit in with my roommates. It was completely my fault that I took it. I would say 30 minutes after taking it my neuromuscular symptoms worsened dramatically. My spasms increased dramatically and started constricting my chest wall. My dysphagia(trouble swallowing) got way worse and I couldn&amp;#39;t drink. I eventually had a hard time breathing. Everyone just started looking at me and honestly they didn&amp;#39;t try to help. But I can&amp;#39;t blame them because if I went to the ER and said I took a drug there might&amp;#39;ve been a chance that they could&amp;#39;ve been busted. And I don&amp;#39;t want to get people in trouble for an action I took. I then called my Asian friends who have always been there for me. I told them that I took weed. I started telling them how I was a disappointment and failure because I took a drug. For the next hour they talked to me and encouraged me so much. They were there for me at my lowest and the day before I just threw them under the bus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that incident I changed rooms and got a room for myself. I basically didn&amp;#39;t interact with anyone outside of schoolwork.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been 8 months since them. Should I tell my Asian friends that I made that statement? How do I improve? The stuff I said has caused a lot of guilt in me. I feel like there&amp;#39;s something I should do. I feel like I should contribute to the Asian community and learn more about POC.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "298cd47c-1e96-11ed-bd72-fe7bc3f1a69c", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmbm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#94e044", "id": "xr0q4r", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "EstablishmentNo4148", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 3, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfimprovement/comments/xr0q4r/stupid_teen_who_made_racist_remark_while_drunk/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/xr0q4r/stupid_teen_who_made_racist_remark_while_drunk/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1352066, "created_utc": 1664434282.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfimprovement", "selftext": " It's only been a month since i've went back to training school at 30.  \nPicking the pieces of myself.
