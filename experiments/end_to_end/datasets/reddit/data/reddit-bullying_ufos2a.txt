brother whose in junior high keeps getting sexually assaulted by his male classmates. We\u2019ve told the teacher, his counselor, his in school therapist, vice principal and the principal herself. They\u2019ve done nothing. And the principal had the audacity herself to say \u201cif it happens again tell the teacher\u201d. She also blamed my brother for physically defending himself that one time. This has been going on for more than a year. I don\u2019t know what else I could do here, help?\n\n04/28/22 - looks like we\u2019ll be switching him schools after this school year is over. I\u2019ll keep updating and see how this ends.\n\nEdit: I\u2019d like to point out that one of the individuals harassing him has been bullying him since elementary. I know that his classmates (the one harassing him) make inappropriate comments and tried to physically hump him multiple times. Also as frustrating as it sounds, Ik schools tend to do nothing because I\u2019ve seen it happen to my friends but I just wanted to exhaust my options so they don\u2019t come up with some bs excuse \u201coh why didn\u2019t you tell a trusted adult\u201d and whatever. \n\n04/29/22 - I did tell my brother that we should start documenting things. He isn\u2019t attending school today but I\u2019m hoping we could get the in-school report he did so we could have that for documentation purposes.\n\n04/30/22 - My mom is going to try to talk to the school district since we believe that the entire district should revise this and implement better regulations and policies into place. Also we will try switch him schools. Unfortunately in our area it\u2019s hard to find and we\u2019ve been trying to move so maybe if that somehow happens by a miracle that would help as well. Additionally I wanted to make a Sidenote. I wanted to thank you guys for the advice, support you guys have given me.

We\u2019ve told the teacher, his counselor, his in school therapist, vice principal and the principal herself. They\u2019ve done nothing. And the principal had the audacity herself to say \u201cif it happens again tell the teacher\u201d. She also blamed my brother for physically defending himself that one time. This has been going on for more than a year. I don\u2019t know what else I could do here, help?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;04/28/22 - looks like we\u2019ll be switching him schools after this school year is over. I\u2019ll keep updating and see how this ends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I\u2019d like to point out that one of the individuals harassing him has been bullying him since elementary. I know that his classmates (the one harassing him) make inappropriate comments and tried to physically hump him multiple times. Also as frustrating as it sounds, Ik schools tend to do nothing because I\u2019ve seen it happen to my friends but I just wanted to exhaust my options so they don\u2019t come up with some bs excuse \u201coh why didn\u2019t you tell a trusted adult\u201d and whatever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;04/29/22 - I did tell my brother that we should start documenting things. He isn\u2019t attending school today but I\u2019m hoping we could get the in-school report he did so we could have that for documentation purposes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;04/30/22 - My mom is going to try to talk to the school district since we believe that the entire district should revise this and implement better regulations and policies into place. Also we will try switch him schools. Unfortunately in our area it\u2019s hard to find and we\u2019ve been trying to move so maybe if that somehow happens by a miracle that would help as well.

thing. so a warning that this may be long. \n\ni was on a discord server that was originally made back in February. it was originally used for anxiety towards the whole Ukraine thing. overtime we became actual friends. well at least i thought so. i was the youngest there at 19. others were 20-30. it wasn\u2019t exactly uncomfortable because i tend to be around people older than me. mostly because of my professional career. this group of people eventually backfired on me tho. i really try not to bring race into it but i feel like it plays a part with the reaction. the oldest we\u2019re 28-30, all white men. the first incident was over belief systems. i didn\u2019t go along with them, respectfully. instead of just accepting that, they chose to attack me after that. i may have slightly brought it onto myself due to wording but they kept going after i said i didn\u2019t mean to offend anyone. i eventually just tried to end the conversation instead of arguing with them to basically defend myself at this point. not even a few mins later they chose to talk to me like nothing happened. i ignored them for that day and eventually did confront them privately. they said sorry to me, everything was good. i thought we would move past it. that didn\u2019t last long tho. there was another time i was talking about the training i did as a kid (dancer). they decided they had to make me feel bad about what i did as a child just to be where i\u2019m at now. i don\u2019t mean to sound cocky but even tho i\u2019m young, i\u2019m very far ahead with life due to the way my childhood was set up and also who i\u2019m romantically in love with. it really started to come off as that they were projecting but it would still hurt because these people got me comfortable enough then when i told them i wouldn\u2019t talk about my career anymore. they chose to act like they cared telling me they don\u2019t want anyone to feel uncomfortable. i kinda ignored that. you may be asking why didn\u2019t i leave? there were like a couple people i thought were nice. they liked having me there. other reason was because i was thinking it\u2019s in my head. very great at gaslighting my own feelings. so i stuck around a little bit longer. then bashing me around was still a thing, so i decided to fade out. at this point, my partner and people around me were becoming concerned about my well being. it didn\u2019t help that the admin of the server was literally part of it so i had no one to really turn to. the moderators, that were younger, never did anything either. so they pushed me to leave the server. so i did leave. unannounced and everything. i thought that would be the end of it, it was not. the woman, that i\u2019m going to say in the most respectful way i can, she sucks up to these men.  so i didn\u2019t exactly expect this conversation to go well but i chose to speak to her. she was asking me why i left and asking me if i was okay. originally told her i needed

had that interaction with that one girl, i want to stay farrrrrrrr away. \n\nmy biggest concern is my safety tho. i know a couple of them had my twitter. then the one girl that was bothering me was

a warning that this may be long. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i was on a discord server that was originally made back in February. it was originally used for anxiety towards the whole Ukraine thing. overtime we became actual friends. well at least i thought so. i was the youngest there at 19. others were 20-30. it wasn\u2019t exactly uncomfortable because i tend to be around people older than me. mostly because of my professional career. this group of people eventually backfired on me tho. i really try not to bring race into it but i feel like it plays a part with the reaction. the oldest we\u2019re 28-30, all white men. the first incident was over belief systems. i didn\u2019t go along with them, respectfully. instead of just accepting that, they chose to attack me after that. i may have slightly brought it onto myself due to wording but they kept going after i said i didn\u2019t mean to offend anyone. i eventually just tried to end the conversation instead of arguing with them to basically defend myself at this point. not even a few mins later they chose to talk to me like nothing happened. i ignored them for that day and eventually did confront them privately. they said sorry to me, everything was good. i thought we would move past it. that didn\u2019t last long tho. there was another time i was talking about the training i did as a kid (dancer). they decided they had to make me feel bad about what i did as a child just to be where i\u2019m at now. i don\u2019t mean to sound cocky but even tho i\u2019m young, i\u2019m very far ahead with life due to the way my childhood was set up and also who i\u2019m romantically in love with. it really started to come off as that they were projecting but it would still hurt because these people got me comfortable enough then when i told them i wouldn\u2019t talk about my career anymore. they chose to act like they cared telling me they don\u2019t want anyone to feel uncomfortable. i kinda ignored that. you may be asking why didn\u2019t i leave? there were like a couple people i thought were nice. they liked having me there. other reason was because i was thinking it\u2019s in my head. very great at gaslighting my own feelings. so i stuck around a little bit longer. then bashing me around was still a thing, so i decided to fade out. at this point, my partner and people around me were becoming concerned about my well being. it didn\u2019t help that the admin of the server was literally part of it so i had no one to really turn to. the moderators, that were younger, never did anything either. so they pushed me to leave the server. so i did leave. unannounced and everything. i thought that would be the end of it, it was not. the woman, that i\u2019m going to say in the most respectful way i can, she sucks up to these men.  so i didn\u2019t exactly expect this conversation to go well but i chose to speak to her. she was asking me why i left and asking me if i was okay. originally told her i needed space, she was cool about it. i decided to tell her what happened, since it didn\u2019t exactly have anything to do with her. out of nowhere she chose to interrogate me about my personal life. the

It was my fault for being stupid and not standing up for myself. I still hate myself for being a coward and a moron to this day.

I constantly felt horrible, and I would have killed myself if it was not for my fear of going to Hell which was inspired by my worthless Christian upbringing.\n\nI'm beginning to wonder if swallowing all of that poison permanently impacted my development.

So i burned the bridge with them, didnt meet them in person, stopped using facebook and moved on with my life. I have not communicated with them since. My mental health did suffer because of this however this was the only time in my life i was bullied and never ever was bullied again, i now know how to handle and de-escalate these situations. back then I was basically forced to live with a group of people that made me the punchline of every joke, made fun of my appearance and wrote fake hurtful stories about me on facebook and tagged me.\n\nSince then i've moved on, got a great education, fell in love and i'm doing great in my career blah blah blah.\n\nI recently went back on that facebook account to check out if they were still around and noticed that the \"lead person\" continued posting shit for a couple of years after i left, i can still see their comments even though some seem to have unfriended me as i'm still tagged in it. They seem to have had a falling out between them over the years too.\n\nI don't particularly care but i have a few choices:\n\n1. Untag it, block, move on.\n\n2. Message them and call them out + seek an apology. I don't have high hopes of getting a response, and to be honest i don't need an apology, i already have personal closure.\n\n3.

So i burned the bridge with them, didnt meet them in person, stopped using facebook and moved on with my life. I have not communicated with them since. My mental health did suffer because of this however this was the only time in my life i was bullied and never ever was bullied again, i now know how to handle and de-escalate these situations. back then I was basically forced to live with a group of people that made me the punchline of every joke, made fun of my appearance and wrote fake hurtful stories about me on facebook and tagged me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since then i&amp;#39;ve moved on, got a great education, fell in love and i&amp;#39;m doing great in my career blah blah blah.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recently went back on that facebook account to check out if they were still around and noticed that the &amp;quot;lead person&amp;quot; continued posting shit for a couple of years after i left, i can still see their comments even though some seem to have unfriended me as i&amp;#39;m still tagged in it.

this sooooo....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWow. Just got a message from a friend that goes to my old school. The kid that ran me out of that school. just got caught, but I'll get to that later. I spent years with a target on my back for no good reason, I wasn't fat, short, or dumb like most ***stereotypical*** victims. This kid had given others a hard time too, called kids the N word (he isn't black), and used other slurs. He was generally anti-semitic when I was there, and he had been caught cheating several times. Since I left that school, he has been caught drinking, taking drugs, and driving without a license (By a police officer who was someone he was driving around's FATHER), and pled to be forgiven because \"his untreated ADHD was making him do this\". Well, as I found out today, someone has been stealing hundreds, if not thousands of dollars from people around the school. Someone left their phone, recording, in their locker to try to catch who was stealing. The kid, fully unaware, walked right into frame and began to inspect other backpacks. When he got to the one with the phone, he FLIPPED THE PHONE AROUND, REALIZED IT WAS RECORDING, AND STOPPED THE VIDEO. He tried to delete it. If you are an iPhone User, you should know that once you delete something from your camera roll, you can UNDELETE IT. Well, the kid who recorded in the locker, checked his \"recently-deleted folder and FOUND THE VIDEO. Apparently, the brat has just been escorted OFF THE CAMPUS, and he's stolen from quite a few people it sounds like.

Just got a message from a friend that goes to my old school. The kid that ran me out of that school. just got caught, but I&amp;#39;ll get to that later. I spent years with a target on my back for no good reason, I wasn&amp;#39;t fat, short, or dumb like most &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;stereotypical&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; victims. This kid had given others a hard time too, called kids the N word (he isn&amp;#39;t black), and used other slurs. He was generally anti-semitic when I was there, and he had been caught cheating several times. Since I left that school, he has been caught drinking, taking drugs, and driving without a license (By a police officer who was someone he was driving around&amp;#39;s FATHER), and pled to be forgiven because &amp;quot;his untreated ADHD was making him do this&amp;quot;. Well, as I found out today, someone has been stealing hundreds, if not thousands of dollars from people around the school. Someone left their phone, recording, in their locker to try to catch who was stealing. The kid, fully unaware, walked right into frame and began to inspect other backpacks. When he got to the one with the phone, he FLIPPED THE PHONE AROUND, REALIZED IT WAS RECORDING, AND STOPPED THE VIDEO. He tried to delete it. If you are an iPhone User, you should know that once you delete something from your camera roll, you can UNDELETE IT. Well, the kid who recorded in the locker, checked his &amp;quot;recently-deleted folder and FOUND THE VIDEO. Apparently, the brat has just been escorted OFF THE CAMPUS, and he&amp;#39;s stolen from quite a few people it sounds like. My friend says that people think he spent it on drugs, so the police are going to be looking into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Knowing the school, where he got away with a whole bunch of stuff, unless the police do anything, he will get off without having any repercussions. The whole school is full of snotty, rich white kids, and the brat&amp;#39;s parents just so happen to be lawyers.

But then one day I log into my other account and see that one of daves friends tweeted cutting pictures in an attempt to try to trigger people into cutting the caption said something like \"why did they put a tw on a picture of puppies?\" then there was a big blank space underneath and beneath that they had linked to a tweet with someones cutting pictures. now they tweeted it using a hashtag affiliated with the other account.

I brought up the fact he always talks about an alleged friend (I didn't mention the friends name but I knew he would know which one I was talking about) who killed himself (I didnt mention the guys name who killed himself friends name out of respect for them also I said alleged friend because while I can confirm someone killed themselves (It was in the news) I can't confirm they were friends. \n\nI mentioned his \"friend\" because I wanted to point out the hypocrasy and because I was angry that he claims to be against abuse yet is friends with abusers .

He doesnt mention his friend but I am pretty sure that is the incident he is referring to. As far as I know I did not suicide bait him.

So you know i pretty good at school, still i wasn\u2019t weird in any way, or fat, or weak, or small, or any of that, this still makes me think to this day. \n\nWhen starting middle school i had the luck to get assigned to the same class with my best friend. \nBut in the neighbouring class was one kid, that apparently had ADHD that alway ticked me off, i didn\u2019t react at first but i think his ADHD got him to continue. That\u2019s where i started my first fight. Apparently he had quite an amount of friends tho. So like +5 friends joined the fight, 4 of his class and one of my class. The fight got broken up pretty quickly by the teachers. Then the first school trip came. In Austria you typically make a 5 day trip each year somewhere. This trip was pretty early in the 1st school year and should had the function to get to know each other better. I got in a room with my buddy and 3 others of my class which i thought were pretty chill. \nAfter a day or two my friend saw me taking a trash bag every night to the bathroom when i went to take a shower. And he jokingly said \u201cAre you taking a dump in it or what are you gonna do with the bag?\u201d What i answered was that i just used it to put my used underwear in it so there isn\u2019t a mixup with the clean and the dirty laundry. This joke of my friend was what i think the spark of everything. The next day me roommates told the others that i was \u201cPooping in a trash bag\u201d. That rumor followed me trough 3 years. And by the end of the first year almost all the boys of my and the neighbouring class were agains me. The strongest would target me in sports, thinks like intentionally shooting/ throwing balls at my testicles.  \nI never could fight back because if i tried to hit one the others would hold me tight so i was defend less.  the teachers also couldn\u2019t do anything. The had a lot of mild bodily injuries over the 4 years. I even got out of their way by letting my mother give me a ride to and back from school, even though there was a perfect bus connection. \nSadly my friend had also a bit of bullying to fight with, but only by 2-3 guys which i didn\u2019t really notice because we distracted shortly after it all started. Which i was happy, cause i didn\u2019t wanted him to have the same shit to deal with. \n\nOver those 4 years i only made it trough thanks to the support of my family and the things my class board teacher and math teacher had done to support me as much as they could. \nI had a lot of thoughts about suicide self harm or even stealing the hunting rifle from my grandpa, he was a well known hunter, and just shoot and spare the rest of society from those idiots . Those thoughts almost ruined me. Still i made it trough those 4 cruel years by isolating after school and playing videogames and watching anime almost non stop and still got an 1.3 gpa, being one of the best at the graduation. \n\nI took the trouble to take the other polytechnic school, because i didn\u2019t wanted to see anyone again. For this i had a lot of discussions we the community president which made this possible. \n\nStill there were some assholes in the polytechnic school, got in to a fight or two bit still made it trough just fine. \n\nAfter that i started an apprenticeship in one of the most competitive and complex fields. \nThis almost guaranteed me that there wouldn\u2019t be any major amount of idiots.  \nAnd it turned out i was true with my speculation. Got a few good friend with same interest, got to be good friends with my childhood friend, went drinking with those multiple times and doing shit i couldn\u2019t do in those years.

I was so dependent on his friendship to feel more alpha, more attractive to women, more intelligent and more complex instead of the Asperger&amp;#39;s ridden simpleton that I really am, and he ended up bullying me and making me feel stupid and like a bitch instead, all because he felt it must have been convenient to bully someone who&amp;#39;s self esteem was already suffering because I couldn&amp;#39;t keep afloat in that city with that stressful job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, just typing this all out really makes me feel better, feel free to reply however you guys want. No, I wasn&amp;#39;t gay for this guy, he just seemed to be a lot like me in a bunch of ways but better overall.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sw9l", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "tdpkq6", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "thr0waway3028", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 5, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/bullying/comments/tdpkq6/getting_over_a_roommate_who_bullied_me_that_i/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/tdpkq6/getting_over_a_roommate_who_bullied_me_that_i/", "subreddit_subscribers": 7766, "created_utc": 1647233911.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "bullying", "selftext": "*Rachel:*\n\n*All my life, I have always been underestimated.
