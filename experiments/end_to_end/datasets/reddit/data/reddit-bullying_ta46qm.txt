I wouldn\u2019t have had the actual push to do this without the posts, encouraging words or red flags of hostile conditions. \n\nBut as of today I resigned from my disgusting inhumane job, turned the letter in to my boss and returned the keys for the office building. I now feel compelled to share my story.\n\nThings that I rather would not share, but feel the need to share. The bullying I experienced does not necessarily cause infringement of any laws because the business is small~ 17 people and if there are laws they are not applied. \n\nI have experienced discrimination against having a chronic illness (type 1 \u201cjuvenile\u201d diabetes). I am told I am burdening the system by needing frequent breaks to use the bathroom, drink water, have a snack etc. Everytime I have had to step away I\u2019ve been asked why I don\u2019t seek better therapeutic alternatives (cgm, pump, etc) but due to low wages and high copays, I\u2019m not in a position where I can. And even if I was, it does not stop the problem entirely. I experience a low 2-3 times a month (non workplace or life threatening) and a high bg number every 2 months at most. None of of cost or lower performance other than going to the bubbler or sink for water. I may make a small typo when low when unable to move from my desk to correct it. \n\nI\u2019m denied doctors appointments unless it is ok per the boss which means appoints are either before or after work. , My doctors are top notch but not available after 5pm or 8am? and a few Saturdays. Except for emergencies or when I need to speak to a doctor. If I have to leave I am expected to make up the hours as I do not have pto until after my first year.\n\nI qualify for fmla, but work does not offer it. \n\nIn addition, I along with others are berated at least twice a day for minuet things that often have nothing to do with work. Such as family and personal life, slurs about how their children are taken care of, life choices, the list goes on and on. I could write a series of novels for all of the things I have witnessed as well as experienced. \n\n1. I was yelled at for not putting a lab in the correct place. I was not trained for the position and just starting at the time.\n\n2. I am often in trouble and disciplined for actions I did not execute. I am simply tattled on by a coworker to my boss or my boss tattles to a doctor. I can plea my case all I want but no hr= no assistance, despite clear, concessive documentation. \n\n3.  Told by employees that it was big of the boss to hire someone with diabetes because they know how much it can disrupt work. The boss has a connection with a type one diabetic. (I decline to not go further as I do not want to reveal myself). \n\n4. My colleagues have fixed hours. I am told to stay until all work is done for the day. This can mean 5, but I have stayed at work as late as 7:30. If overtime peaks too high, I have to rush to get out in a clear time. I have one 30 minute paid lunch, no breaks. \n\n5. Holidays are \u201cpaid\u201d but not. Employees are required to work four 10 hour shifts to  obtain holiday pay. If we call out the week of a holiday, we are not paid. If there is a snowstorm, hurricane, tornado etc and a direct threat is posed we are unpaid for the day as well.\n\n6. No employee handbook or policies. \n\n\n7. It\u2019s taken a downturn, stress is high and I am now starting to experience ptsd symptoms because I stayed there thinking it would turn better. I experience night terrors to the point I wake up crying or screaming about something happening relating to the workplace. I also experience stress symptoms such as high blood pressure and heart palpitations. I have no underlying or preexisting conditions relating to cardiac. I have been admitted to the er several times with no findings other than stress. \n\n8. Also because benefits such as paid insurance, paid lunch and the positions themselves are held over employees heads. It gets to the point where I was bullied into not speaking to family about anything going on as it is a \u201chipaa\u201d violation and I could be fired. But if it\u2019s personal, and not involving a patient it is not hippa. I am seeing my pcp Tuesday and am resigning because I cannot take this anymore. \n\n9. I was accused of violating hippa three times. I have no evidence and several witnesses. \n\n10. There is a core group of people who carry out the bullying. They all have worked here 10-15+ years, the actions are neglected of those people. \n\nI really need support, can anyone provide me with some links or support groups, even a suggestion. I am seeing my pcp on Tuesday to receive suggestions on therapy, or what I can do for income and healthcare support. :)", "author_fullname": "t2_8x1mpqrq", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Resigning from hostile workplace/ consistent bullying", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bullying", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_t7br66", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1646494039.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.bullying", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for the motivation to do this, community!

I can plea my case all I want but no hr= no assistance, despite clear, concessive documentation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Told by employees that it was big of the boss to hire someone with diabetes because they know how much it can disrupt work. The boss has a connection with a type one diabetic. (I decline to not go further as I do not want to reveal myself). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My colleagues have fixed hours. I am told to stay until all work is done for the day. This can mean 5, but I have stayed at work as late as 7:30. If overtime peaks too high, I have to rush to get out in a clear time. I have one 30 minute paid lunch, no breaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holidays are \u201cpaid\u201d but not. Employees are required to work four 10 hour shifts to  obtain holiday pay. If we call out the week of a holiday, we are not paid. If there is a snowstorm, hurricane, tornado etc and a direct threat is posed we are unpaid for the day as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No employee handbook or policies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s taken a downturn, stress is high and I am now starting to experience ptsd symptoms because I stayed there thinking it would turn better. I experience night terrors to the point I wake up crying or screaming about something happening relating to the workplace. I also experience stress symptoms such as high blood pressure and heart palpitations. I have no underlying or preexisting conditions relating to cardiac. I have been admitted to the er several times with no findings other than stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also because benefits such as paid insurance, paid lunch and the positions themselves are held over employees heads. It gets to the point where I was bullied into not speaking to family about anything going on as it is a \u201chipaa\u201d violation and I could be fired. But if it\u2019s personal, and not involving a patient it is not hippa. I am seeing my pcp Tuesday and am resigning because I cannot take this anymore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was accused of violating hippa three times. I have no evidence and several witnesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a core group of people who carry out the bullying. They all have worked here 10-15+ years, the actions are neglected of those people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really need support, can anyone provide me with some links or support groups, even a suggestion. I am seeing my pcp on Tuesday to receive suggestions on therapy, or what I can do for income and healthcare support. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sw9l", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "t7br66", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Garden-Rare", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 10, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/bullying/comments/t7br66/resigning_from_hostile_workplace_consistent/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/t7br66/resigning_from_hostile_workplace_consistent/", "subreddit_subscribers": 7766, "created_utc": 1646494039.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "bullying", "selftext": "you are better than them", "author_fullname": "t2_15ib2g", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Fuck Bullying", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bullying", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_t6e9nu", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 28, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 28, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1646381918.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.bullying", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;you are better than them&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sw9l", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "t6e9nu", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Tracing1701", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 6, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/bullying/comments/t6e9nu/fuck_bullying/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/t6e9nu/fuck_bullying/", "subreddit_subscribers": 7766, "created_utc": 1646381918.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "bullying", "selftext": "Hey guys!\n\nI'm a student at uni.

So im sure that this story &amp; question has been asked many times before however we are at wits end with it. If this isn't the appropriate forum then please send me onto another for we just need help. \n\nMy sister is being servery bullied online. She is 17, and the people doing it were once supposed friends. My sister is refusing to go to school, as the bully's are taking photos of my sister and then reposting them to twitter, edited, playing on her believed body issues. They are posting them across social media but then deleting them so we can't report them anyway. There are many other problems but I think this is the one that is harming my sister the most.\n\nWe have told the school, for which there was an investigation, and then the main leader of the gang left. But she left because she accused someone of something else and that turned out to be false.\u00a0 But yet, the bullying continues, even after the main gang leader left.

People were staring, but no one intervened b/c it is hard to tell what is going on without the context and because it really requires a ton of courage to not just stand up against bullies once, but continually if they keep on continuing with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sw9l", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "t1sks2", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 9, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/bullying/comments/t1sks2/bullied_by_awful_housemates/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/t1sks2/bullied_by_awful_housemates/", "subreddit_subscribers": 7766, "created_utc": 1645865750.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "bullying", "selftext": "Ive had 3 random people come up to me and say I look like a dog and then pretend to be nice about it and it's getting really annoying now and kinda hurtful.

Bullying doesn\u2019t know a specific age, sex or location; however, it is most frequently exhibited in young teens at schools. The negative behaviour is either verbal, physical or social such as threatening to harm, hitting or spreading rumours to name a few respectively.\n\nI\u2019m writing this around my 29th birthday which marks almost 15 years after major bullying incidents in my life. Now, and after many months of continuous self-reflection, pursuit of the path of self-mastery/self-improvement and metaphorically chasing the man I admire and always needed, I have discovered much about bullying and its causes and effects. Nevertheless, I was only able to arrive at such discoveries once I sat in the observer\u2019s seat of my life and not the absorber; and once I established that I want to demolish all habits that hold me back or even break my alignment with the vision of my future self.\n\nI, as any other teen, have been bullied repetitively during different stages of my life, most impactfully though at the age of 15. I, also as any other teen, have done my share of bullying whether I was aware of it or not at the time. One crucially common ground that both the bully and the bullied will always share is the following: they are both victims to a much deeper and external root cause. It is deep because it involves unearthing so many psychological layers to arrive at, and it is external in the sense that it is uncontrollably acquired and does not sprout from within them.\n\n**Storyline**\n\nFor a lengthy period of time, the bully would harass, push, shove and scorn my inability or unwillingness to fight back. They would at first entice me to fight back either verbally or by frequent physical attacks, then dare me to fight back \u201cCome on then! Hit me! HIT ME! Show me what you got!\u201d and then ultimately threaten to beat me outside school with the gang. This ongoing psychological and physical behaviour spanned roughly an entire school year. An entire year of me bottling up all this behaviour and its mental strain; an entire year of saying to myself I should do something and not doing anything; an entire year of creating hypothetical scenarios in my head of impending doom and of me being beaten and battered; an entire year of not sharing this with anyone as I never felt reassurance or a sense of safety from anyone around me; an entire year of living in and out of fear every single day.\n\nThe whole process was incremental, and towards the end of the year my tolerance was so high yet so straining I needed to do something. I finally gathered the guts to sit my father down and tell him the story. I obviously told him a mild and easy-on-the-ears version not the apocalyptic version in my head at the time. His reply was to fight back! Every time we would talk about the problem, he would encourage me to \u201chave no fear\u201d and fight back! He would reassure me that the scenarios in my hear are just that: in my head. Ultimately, we \u201cagreed\u201d, more like he alone agreed, that I would fight back and he would accompany me to school and stay there until all was okay. The main takeaway here though is that none of this even remotely alleviated my strain and if anything made it worse. On that day, I weirdly woke up slightly less strained but that feeling diminished the closer we got to school until it disappeared upon arrival.\n\nMy brother and I dismounted the car and walked into the playground. My dad stayed in the car parked in the parking lot adjacent to the playground but could not necessarily see the latter in its entirety. My brother and I strolled the playground until we came across one of the main bully\u2019s accomplices who immediately began to scorn me. For the first time I reluctantly decided to put in some action but my body was so tense that I barely shoved and lightly kicked him. My younger brother however, pushed him against the wall, held him secure and whacked him with a couple of solid punches to his body leaving him in the foetal position and in pain. I felt a slight relief at that moment; my father however, was unable to witness this event so I rushed to tell him how the story unfolded. I can clearly remember so many mixed feelings flowing in and out of my mind some of relief and comfort but more of fear, lack of confidence and cowardice. I got to the car and told him how I kicked and shoved and how my brother punched, stressing more on the kicked and shoved to partly overcompensate for how little I did in terms of kicking and shoving and to partly reassure him that he can go now all is okay.\n\nAccordingly, he said that we\u2019ll talk more at home after school and was on his way to work. I was left there in a puddle of unanswered questions and mixed emotions. I did what he told me, I fought back, or at least I thought I did, why am I still in a state of disarray and discomfort. Bottle up and move on, that was my go-to coping mechanism at the time towards anything that induced fear. After that, the year was almost over, but I did receive some more bullying. This time in the form of \u201cYou so weak you gotta have your younger brother fight for you\u201d. And just as soon as even more people (some were actual confidantes of mine) started to tune in to the bullying, the school year ended.\n\n**Realisation**\n\nFast forward to present day me conducting a personal self-reflection session when I suddenly came to a monumental realisation. This realisation was associated with the aforementioned bullying incident and had altered my back-then young teenage mindset in the following way: a new fear seedling was planted in my head and was linked to actions like \u201cfight back\u201d or \u201cmake the first punch\u201d. As a young teenager in somewhat of a male-centred culture I couldn\u2019t walk around with a mindset like that, I\u2019d be bullied at every corner! Subsequently, my mind developed a new coping mechanism that would deviate people\u2019s attention away from my fear and create a false sense of self-confidence as I carry myself. As an example, I became a \u201cbetter listener\u201d who avoids talking about themselves; and to sustain conversations and be likeable I would often tell people what they want to hear and thus became a \u201cbetter liar\u201d in the process.\n\nAs all these thoughts and realisations made their way into my head a burst of emotions accompanied with rivers of tear made their way in too! All the while I was understanding more and more the butterfly effect of that fear seedling and how it truly impacted not just my ability to literally fight back, but a plethora of other personal traits as well: self-confidence, sense of responsibility, risk-taking ability, decision making ability, etc. The coping mechanism created a vacant shell, a disguise, behind which all personal progress and self-improvement was halted. I was a 29-year-old husband with the attributes of a 15-year-old teenager! What a true blessing of a realisation this was!\n\nI cannot fathom the number of thoughts that were bouncing around in my head; my neurons were firing a New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks display! Do I blame the bully? He is a victim of his own circumstances and he is bullying uncontrollably and maybe even unwillingly! Do I blame my father? He is also a victim of his own upbringing and is doing his absolute best with all what he knows and all is consciousness to protect and defend me! Maybe he was fearful himself and hence why I never truly felt reassurance! Do I blame friends, teachers, my surroundings? That\u2019s when I realised, the solution is not out there but inside me. Blaming others will lead to more blaming and to more victimisation. I decided I no longer want to be a victim of this vicious cycle. I decided to break the cycle then and there and give myself my own rite of passage into manhood. I knew however, that it could only be done with the one thing that was absent all this time: action! With that, an out-of-body sense of relief came over me. I felt the weight of heavy metal shackles being removed from my hands and feet. I felt love for the first time, towards myself and in turn towards my God-sent wife! I called her unconsciously and spilled all my emotions over the phone.\n\n**Rite of Passage**\n\nI had started boxing training a few months prior to the realisation but I had never properly sparred anyone. I messaged my coach while in a pond of joyous tears and with so much exuberance to schedule a fight. I didn\u2019t care who or what I was fighting in the ring because I knew I was truly fighting my own demons. Fight was scheduled in a few minutes and even more tears and more relief and more weight off my shoulders and more love came out of me!\n\nWhilst on my pursuit of self-mastery, my journey was, and still is, embellished with guidance and motivational content from a man I\u2019ve come to admire: Wes Watson. In his videos he shares the richest content on self-mastery and how he made his way to great heights. One quote or thought that was resonating with me at the time of the realisation was as follows: \u201cYou will never overcome what you run from\u201d. It all suddenly made so much sense: to earn my rite of passage into manhood I needed to find EVERYTHING I avoid and fear and not just overcome it, but destroy it and own it!\n\nMy life has entirely improved since then as I set out to level up all the teenage attributes one by one. Writing this and sharing it online is a level up in itself and something I\u2019ve feared and avoided all along! Nothing can stop me onwards from becoming the man I admire, aspire to be and needed all along. A man who loves unconditionally, a man who holds himself responsible and accountable relentlessly, a man who fears absolutely nothing, a man who carries his smile everywhere he goes, a man who lifts everyone around him, a man who is rich and wealthy personally, financially and physically! In the words of Wes Watson: \u201cAll my all till the day I fall.

Bullying doesn\u2019t know a specific age, sex or location; however, it is most frequently exhibited in young teens at schools. The negative behaviour is either verbal, physical or social such as threatening to harm, hitting or spreading rumours to name a few respectively.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m writing this around my 29th birthday which marks almost 15 years after major bullying incidents in my life. Now, and after many months of continuous self-reflection, pursuit of the path of self-mastery/self-improvement and metaphorically chasing the man I admire and always needed, I have discovered much about bullying and its causes and effects. Nevertheless, I was only able to arrive at such discoveries once I sat in the observer\u2019s seat of my life and not the absorber; and once I established that I want to demolish all habits that hold me back or even break my alignment with the vision of my future self.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I, as any other teen, have been bullied repetitively during different stages of my life, most impactfully though at the age of 15. I, also as any other teen, have done my share of bullying whether I was aware of it or not at the time. One crucially common ground that both the bully and the bullied will always share is the following: they are both victims to a much deeper and external root cause. It is deep because it involves unearthing so many psychological layers to arrive at, and it is external in the sense that it is uncontrollably acquired and does not sprout from within them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storyline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a lengthy period of time, the bully would harass, push, shove and scorn my inability or unwillingness to fight back. They would at first entice me to fight back either verbally or by frequent physical attacks, then dare me to fight back \u201cCome on then! Hit me! HIT ME! Show me what you got!\u201d and then ultimately threaten to beat me outside school with the gang. This ongoing psychological and physical behaviour spanned roughly an entire school year. An entire year of me bottling up all this behaviour and its mental strain; an entire year of saying to myself I should do something and not doing anything; an entire year of creating hypothetical scenarios in my head of impending doom and of me being beaten and battered; an entire year of not sharing this with anyone as I never felt reassurance or a sense of safety from anyone around me; an entire year of living in and out of fear every single day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whole process was incremental, and towards the end of the year my tolerance was so high yet so straining I needed to do something. I finally gathered the guts to sit my father down and tell him the story. I obviously told him a mild and easy-on-the-ears version not the apocalyptic version in my head at the time. His reply was to fight back! Every time we would talk about the problem, he would encourage me to \u201chave no fear\u201d and fight back! He would reassure me that the scenarios in my hear are just that: in my head. Ultimately, we \u201cagreed\u201d, more like he alone agreed, that I would fight back and he would accompany me to school and stay there until all was okay. The main takeaway here though is that none of this even remotely alleviated my strain and if anything made it worse. On that day, I weirdly woke up slightly less strained but that feeling diminished the closer we got to school until it disappeared upon arrival.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My brother and I dismounted the car and walked into the playground. My dad stayed in the car parked in the parking lot adjacent to the playground but could not necessarily see the latter in its entirety. My brother and I strolled the playground until we came across one of the main bully\u2019s accomplices who immediately began to scorn me. For the first time I reluctantly decided to put in some action but my body was so tense that I barely shoved and lightly kicked him. My younger brother however, pushed him against the wall, held him secure and whacked him with a couple of solid punches to his body leaving him in the foetal position and in pain. I felt a slight relief at that moment; my father however, was unable to witness this event so I rushed to tell him how the story unfolded. I can clearly remember so many mixed feelings flowing in and out of my mind some of relief and comfort but more of fear, lack of confidence and cowardice. I got to the car and told him how I kicked and shoved and how my brother punched, stressing more on the kicked and shoved to partly overcompensate for how little I did in terms of kicking and shoving and to partly reassure him that he can go now all is okay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, he said that we\u2019ll talk more at home after school and was on his way to work. I was left there in a puddle of unanswered questions and mixed emotions. I did what he told me, I fought back, or at least I thought I did, why am I still in a state of disarray and discomfort. Bottle up and move on, that was my go-to coping mechanism at the time towards anything that induced fear. After that, the year was almost over, but I did receive some more bullying. This time in the form of \u201cYou so weak you gotta have your younger brother fight for you\u201d. And just as soon as even more people (some were actual confidantes of mine) started to tune in to the bullying, the school year ended.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Realisation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to present day me conducting a personal self-reflection session when I suddenly came to a monumental realisation. This realisation was associated with the aforementioned bullying incident and had altered my back-then young teenage mindset in the following way: a new fear seedling was planted in my head and was linked to actions like \u201cfight back\u201d or \u201cmake the first punch\u201d. As a young teenager in somewhat of a male-centred culture I couldn\u2019t walk around with a mindset like that, I\u2019d be bullied at every corner! Subsequently, my mind developed a new coping mechanism that would deviate people\u2019s attention away from my fear and create a false sense of self-confidence as I carry myself. As an example, I became a \u201cbetter listener\u201d who avoids talking about themselves; and to sustain conversations and be likeable I would often tell people what they want to hear and thus became a \u201cbetter liar\u201d in the process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As all these thoughts and realisations made their way into my head a burst of emotions accompanied with rivers of tear made their way in too! All the while I was understanding more and more the butterfly effect of that fear seedling and how it truly impacted not just my ability to literally fight back, but a plethora of other personal traits as well: self-confidence, sense of responsibility, risk-taking ability, decision making ability, etc. The coping mechanism created a vacant shell, a disguise, behind which all personal progress and self-improvement was halted. I was a 29-year-old husband with the attributes of a 15-year-old teenager! What a true blessing of a realisation this was!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cannot fathom the number of thoughts that were bouncing around in my head; my neurons were firing a New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks display! Do I blame the bully? He is a victim of his own circumstances and he is bullying uncontrollably and maybe even unwillingly! Do I blame my father? He is also a victim of his own upbringing and is doing his absolute best with all what he knows and all is consciousness to protect and defend me! Maybe he was fearful himself and hence why I never truly felt reassurance! Do I blame friends, teachers, my surroundings? That\u2019s when I realised, the solution is not out there but inside me. Blaming others will lead to more blaming and to more victimisation. I decided I no longer want to be a victim of this vicious cycle. I decided to break the cycle then and there and give myself my own rite of passage into manhood. I knew however, that it could only be done with the one thing that was absent all this time: action! With that, an out-of-body sense of relief came over me. I felt the weight of heavy metal shackles being removed from my hands and feet. I felt love for the first time, towards myself and in turn towards my God-sent wife! I called her unconsciously and spilled all my emotions over the phone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rite of Passage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had started boxing training a few months prior to the realisation but I had never properly sparred anyone. I messaged my coach while in a pond of joyous tears and with so much exuberance to schedule a fight. I didn\u2019t care who or what I was fighting in the ring because I knew I was truly fighting my own demons. Fight was scheduled in a few minutes and even more tears and more relief and more weight off my shoulders and more love came out of me!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whilst on my pursuit of self-mastery, my journey was, and still is, embellished with guidance and motivational content from a man I\u2019ve come to admire: Wes Watson. In his videos he shares the richest content on self-mastery and how he made his way to great heights. One quote or thought that was resonating with me at the time of the realisation was as follows: \u201cYou will never overcome what you run from\u201d. It all suddenly made so much sense: to earn my rite of passage into manhood I needed to find EVERYTHING I avoid and fear and not just overcome it, but destroy it and own it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My life has entirely improved since then as I set out to level up all the teenage attributes one by one. Writing this and sharing it online is a level up in itself and something I\u2019ve feared and avoided all along! Nothing can stop me onwards from becoming the man I admire, aspire to be and needed all along.

I can say, I didn't understand what people could normally act \"genuinely\"(as they call it) stupid, weird, useless, and aggressive. They kinda have negative words for everything and only say it. Literally, for everything, it's even a huge talent to be able to explain everything from a negative point of view. Of course, they have those widely known narcissistic excuses, they are blaming others for exactly the wrong thing they do. And they are always absolutely shamelessly proud of themselves. I can't say here is one thing it could deserve pride or even be useful for anything though. Even if once they succeed in making idiots out of others, it doesn't make something anyway. Like, what they got? They made me believe in a second I'm a hopeless idiot? The next second gonna understand I'm not. And what's wrong to be an idiot... They made me worry for a moment or spoil some things I did lately? Is that the power? But it's just a weird try to bother without any reason. I don't mention the cases it causes harm, it's a thing of law so far, still hardly a \"power\" or something to be proud of. They can't change someone this way, by calling white black, especially can't change themselves. Things never were like they see them. So they are proud of nothing, happy of nothing, they believe they won something from others, but in fact, just living in darkness. And the reason people put attention to them never is that they deserve it. But it seems doing this shit is the meaning of their life.  \n\nThe fact people can openly be so boldly aggressively idiotic is the hardest thing for me to understand. Also, they could have a lack of understanding of other people and of anything that's going on on earth at all. Like, wait what? They are really like that?... Still don't understand. But it does happen. Well, I can act idiotic if I'm affected for a second when it suddenly feels like if I kick someone right now I'll be at ease then, and the next second I feel very much wtf about it.

I can say, I didn&amp;#39;t understand what people could normally act &amp;quot;genuinely&amp;quot;(as they call it) stupid, weird, useless, and aggressive. They kinda have negative words for everything and only say it. Literally, for everything, it&amp;#39;s even a huge talent to be able to explain everything from a negative point of view. Of course, they have those widely known narcissistic excuses, they are blaming others for exactly the wrong thing they do. And they are always absolutely shamelessly proud of themselves. I can&amp;#39;t say here is one thing it could deserve pride or even be useful for anything though. Even if once they succeed in making idiots out of others, it doesn&amp;#39;t make something anyway. Like, what they got? They made me believe in a second I&amp;#39;m a hopeless idiot? The next second gonna understand I&amp;#39;m not. And what&amp;#39;s wrong to be an idiot... They made me worry for a moment or spoil some things I did lately? Is that the power? But it&amp;#39;s just a weird try to bother without any reason. I don&amp;#39;t mention the cases it causes harm, it&amp;#39;s a thing of law so far, still hardly a &amp;quot;power&amp;quot; or something to be proud of. They can&amp;#39;t change someone this way, by calling white black, especially can&amp;#39;t change themselves. Things never were like they see them. So they are proud of nothing, happy of nothing, they believe they won something from others, but in fact, just living in darkness. And the reason people put attention to them never is that they deserve it. But it seems doing this shit is the meaning of their life.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fact people can openly be so boldly aggressively idiotic is the hardest thing for me to understand. Also, they could have a lack of understanding of other people and of anything that&amp;#39;s going on on earth at all. Like, wait what? They are really like that?... Still don&amp;#39;t understand. But it does happen. Well, I can act idiotic if I&amp;#39;m affected for a second when it suddenly feels like if I kick someone right now I&amp;#39;ll be at ease then, and the next second I feel very much wtf about it. But to do it systematically always, seriously making a crowd against a target person, meticulously escaping every single possible critic? What do they have in mind, a norepinephrine cocktail?

I  can't believe it's really been that long ago. But it was early during the bush administration. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had a bully, well i was gay so I dealt with a lot from a lot of assholes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI  had this real jer of a bully Dave, I tried... every  way of resolving the situation. Me and my parents tried everything that was supposed to be done. Reported him, complained, tried to be nice, tried to resolve it... the sociopath wouldn't let up and no one listened or believed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI searched school rules, school policies, and searched and prayed. The conclusion I came to is that bullying is very difficult to stop, insanely hard to prove and there didn't seem to be any god damned recourse. We literally heard him get the exact same warning speech from the guidance counselor over meetings and nothing was done except I missed classes while failing to get anything done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut in my search I found something else to accuse him of. It wasn't bullying, I didn't go all epic pro revenge or anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom just told the counselor, a little white lie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurns out that proving bullying for no rational cause is like trying to find bigfoot, but.. if you just accuse them of not accepting no for an answer after you dump them....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell turns out that isn't something that you even NEED to prove.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurns out that accusing someone of stalking/domestic abuse is so much easier to prove than bullying is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom told the counselor that the REAL Situation was I broke up with Dave and he wouldn't take no for answer, and was stalking me and the violence, hitting me, taking my shit, ect. And it was almost to the point were we were going to have to get the police involved and do real stalker charges ect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow.. while I was gay, I had absolutely no reason to believe he was. But I *really* didn't give a shit. It wasn't a matter of anything but stopping the bullying. My understanding is that when the guidance counselor called him in for a meeting about it he denied being gay ect\n\nBut we didn't want him to get in any \"real trouble\" he was a good kid, he just needed to leave me alone and take no for an answer.  My mom also suggested he needed therapy for the whole in the closet thing, but he might be happier if his entire family did a family therapy session ect. I told them that I knew he smoked pot and I suspected he was abusing OxyContin. This was in the early days of the Oxy epidemic and trust me, they took that accusation real seriously. Had either of these statements been a lie I wouldn't have said them. \n\n.Tell a guidance counselor that they don't want someone getting into trouble and they just need counseling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the magical thing was the bullying stopped. The teachers started noticing what was going on. The football coach, HIS football coach.. screamed at him in the hall for messing with me one day and benched him for a game. Like shit... I couldn't believe that it happened. \n\nThe more he denied being in the closet they more insistent they got on him about stop being in denial. After like 3 session with the counselor he finally admitted to have been bullying me because I was an easy target.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTook like half a god damned dozen More sessions before they finally believed him. But to get to that point he had to confess to being a heartless jackass to me for zero reason whatsoever, on so many occasions that they had to expel him for bullying, way to go nearly impossible to prove zero tolerance rules.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that we had a nice talk with the guidance counselor over the whole situation. Well it wasn't a nice talk at all. They wanted to do all kinds of shit to me for lying. My dad just said...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Well you didn't take us seriously when we told the truth, the only detail that was a lie was that they used to date, everything else was true. The teachers finally started noticing he was doing after you told them \"What was REALLY going on\" and it had been going on for months. But you idiots failed to CARE about any of that until you legitimately were afraid that the asshole was going to rape him in the bathroom or kidnap him and drive them both off a bridge in a murder suicide or something.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's not true\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"TELL ME, WHAT DID YOU DO BEFORE THE WHOLE THEY USED TO DATE THING? and WHAT DID YOU ACTUALLY DO AFTER?\" he bellowed.\n\nThe 5 minutes of silence was pretty much all that could to be said at that point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut truly it was amazing. Like seriously amazing how well the whole situation worked out. And it's truly shocking how domestic abuse mimicked simple common bullying, and once tiny perception  changed everyone started seeing a sociopath and a victim, sure they might have thought he was an abusive ex boyfriend, but at least finally saw what was going on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n20 years later I don't have any regrets doing it to the prick either. I mean forcing him into drug treatment over a little weed and forcing them into family therapy over their gay son.. god what cruel and unusual punishment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really do hope that the therapy got them somewhere.", "author_fullname": "t2_6xbbdslr", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How we stopped my bully.", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bullying", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_sd1ntd", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 17, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "spoiler", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1643187641.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.bullying", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been 20 years since this happened.

My understanding is that when the guidance counselor called him in for a meeting about it he denied being gay ect&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we didn&amp;#39;t want him to get in any &amp;quot;real trouble&amp;quot; he was a good kid, he just needed to leave me alone and take no for an answer.  My mom also suggested he needed therapy for the whole in the closet thing, but he might be happier if his entire family did a family therapy session ect. I told them that I knew he smoked pot and I suspected he was abusing OxyContin. This was in the early days of the Oxy epidemic and trust me, they took that accusation real seriously. Had either of these statements been a lie I wouldn&amp;#39;t have said them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;.Tell a guidance counselor that they don&amp;#39;t want someone getting into trouble and they just need counseling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the magical thing was the bullying stopped. The teachers started noticing what was going on. The football coach, HIS football coach.. screamed at him in the hall for messing with me one day and benched him for a game. Like shit... I couldn&amp;#39;t believe that it happened. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The more he denied being in the closet they more insistent they got on him about stop being in denial. After like 3 session with the counselor he finally admitted to have been bullying me because I was an easy target.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Took like half a god damned dozen More sessions before they finally believed him. But to get to that point he had to confess to being a heartless jackass to me for zero reason whatsoever, on so many occasions that they had to expel him for bullying, way to go nearly impossible to prove zero tolerance rules.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that we had a nice talk with the guidance counselor over the whole situation. Well it wasn&amp;#39;t a nice talk at all. They wanted to do all kinds of shit to me for lying. My dad just said...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well you didn&amp;#39;t take us seriously when we told the truth, the only detail that was a lie was that they used to date, everything else was true. The teachers finally started noticing he was doing after you told them &amp;quot;What was REALLY going on&amp;quot; and it had been going on for months. But you idiots failed to CARE about any of that until you legitimately were afraid that the asshole was going to rape him in the bathroom or kidnap him and drive them both off a bridge in a murder suicide or something.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not true&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;TELL ME, WHAT DID YOU DO BEFORE THE WHOLE THEY USED TO DATE THING? and WHAT DID YOU ACTUALLY DO AFTER?&amp;quot; he bellowed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 5 minutes of silence was pretty much all that could to be said at that point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But truly it was amazing. Like seriously amazing how well the whole situation worked out. And it&amp;#39;s truly shocking how domestic abuse mimicked simple common bullying, and once tiny perception  changed everyone started seeing a sociopath and a victim, sure they might have thought he was an abusive ex boyfriend, but at least finally saw what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;20 years later I don&amp;#39;t have any regrets doing it to the prick either. I mean forcing him into drug treatment over a little weed and forcing them into family therapy over their gay son.. god what cruel and unusual punishment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really do hope that the therapy got them somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": true, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sw9l", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "sd1ntd", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dunnachius", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 9, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/bullying/comments/sd1ntd/how_we_stopped_my_bully/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/sd1ntd/how_we_stopped_my_bully/", "subreddit_subscribers": 7766, "created_utc": 1643187641.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "bullying", "selftext": "", "author_fullname": "t2_1ni63ah5", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How do you deal with trauma after being bullied?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bullying", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_scmcyr", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1643140597.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.bullying", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": null, "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sw9l", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "scmcyr", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mickcheck", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 5, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/bullying/comments/scmcyr/how_do_you_deal_with_trauma_after_being_bullied/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/scmcyr/how_do_you_deal_with_trauma_after_being_bullied/", "subreddit_subscribers": 7766, "created_utc": 1643140597.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "bullying", "selftext": "Constant reoccurring things with work mate like being ignored, ostracized, not laughing @ your joke yet laughing at someone else saying the same joke. \nThings like making the social weather awkward between classmates, being a brick when approached for the simplest things and acting all bubbly and dandy when wanting something from u / someone else.

Even the bullies back in school who got shitty grades are doing 10x better than me now 10 years later. I am 25 and poor, unemployed, foreveralone and friendless. Also I am treated like shit by everyone. I am messed up really bad due to excessive bullying back in school and I have developed cptsd.\n\nSometimes I check out fb profiles of my old bullies to see how far they made it in life and from what I have seen they have amazing lives compared to mine. Karma definitely doesn't exist. I know you guys are gonna say that 'people only post their best moments on fb' but their lives are gotta be way better than mine if they are able to have moments like that in their lives. There's no hope for me to change anything either because I am dumber than a box of rocks and I am the laziest person I know. Lately the only thing I enjoy anymore is sleeping and eating. How pathetic is that? How can a person's life be this messed up? I deserve a world record for having the shittiest life ever. It feels like I was cursed using some kind of satanic ritual when I was a baby because there's no way life can go so wrong like this for a normal person.\n\nIf I had any idea I was doomed to have such terrible terrible things happening in my life then I would have killed myself when I was 5.

Feel free to skip the story, and scroll down to the lesson I learned, at the bottom of this post.\n\nSo growing up, I had this childhood friend,  which we were like two peas in a pod. we did everything together. Visited each other, joined the same classes, went to the same schools, shared the same memories, had the same humor, etc. We were inseparable and people got our names confused. We even have the same birthday. We were twins, I guess you could say. I'll call her R.\n\nA few years later, high school comes around. Everything changed. Including her. My best friend, R,  gained a lot of popularity, being really pretty and everything. She becomes her class president, a good looking bf, practically got everything she wanted. For some reason, she was bitter to me as she began to gain this stardom at school (ignoring me, rolling her eyes at me, avoiding me, physically switching seats in class to be away from me to sit next to someone else). I don't know why she was like that to me, but I still continued stay around her, being my childhood friend, my shyness of making new friends, and being best friends with the popular girl getting clout and everything. I hung close to R. I sat with the \"popular kids\" at the lunch table, which really boosted my small ego because I was friends with R. In those moments of life, I felt like I was on top of the world, sitting next to them at lunch, looking so cool. I forgot to mention that my high school is extremely small and so if you don't hang out with the \"popular kids\" then you're pretty much by yourself.\n\nAs I hung out with R and sat with the cool kids, on the outside I acted normal. On the inside, I was miserable. All R and them would talk about is hanging out with others, partying outside of school with each other, and plans to go on roadtrips together during the school year, all of which I was clearly excluded from. I would ask if I could join, but they would just talk over me. My voice isn't quiet. Every single person at the table was asked individually out loud if these plans worked for them. Except me. They didn't ask or talk to me at all. I only sat there to be with R, my childhood \"friend\", who was the one making the plans with everyone without me. This happened three years of high school. There were days when I would leave the table early saying I had work to do but actually was crying in the bathroom. It was pretty rough, you could say. I felt so lonely. No one hung out with me, nor wanted to talk with me. People who weren't a part of us assumed that I was just another one of them, but I really wasn't. I wasn't sure if I did something wrong that they didn't like or if wanted me to be with them on purpose just to make me feel bad about myself. I was nice to them. I liked them. I tried making them laugh. I was talked over, ignored.\n\nOne of the actions that hit me the hardest was bringing up the idea of a joint birthday party to celebrate everyone's birthday in January, including my 18th. I made sure to tell everyone around me about this, excluding no one because I know how it felt. Everyone and R thought it was amazing and were thrilled when I said this, and I was happy to celebrate our adulthood age together because we had the same bday. We grew up together, and it was our final year together at high school. Why not celebrate together? One week later, she made a party and invited everyone except me. Even though it was my own idea. I ended up celebrating by myself at home. I saw their pictures. It looked fun. I was really broken that day.\n\nI left R. I don't regret it. I don't talk to her anymore and she doesn't talk to me, but I still speak with the people at the table occasionally (not in the presence of R). But I'm on good terms with them, and they even help me with homework. I still like them, even though they still sit with R. I began sitting with one person elsewhere, away from the \"popular kids\",  having a great time with them and just being a chill duo. I feel much happier, and the person I sat with alone with is one of my closest friends, and we are great in each others' company. We have the same humor,  have similar classes, and everything!\n\nTHE LESSON I LEARNED:  Your feelings matter, and most importantly, you matter. If someone or being around a certain group of people makes you feel bad, please know that your feelings are valid. Trust your gut, and don't doubt yourself.
