I don't want to die, but the suffering of loneliness, and hiding my tears behind a smile makes me hurt. I also think of what would happen if I died, my mom would probably suffer the most, and that makes me not want to die. But, what about everyone else, would they cry? remember me? have good memories of me? I don't want to be weak, but I can't be strong either, though I tried. I want to end my suffering.

Every new place I go, and every new person I meet, the first impression is always good, but after a while they take distance. I guess I can understand it, I also appreciate loneliness every now and then, but even when they see I am down, they just do nothing. I have always been told that a true friend will help you when you are sad, however, I can&amp;#39;t understand why this is not happening to me. I hate to victimize myself, and others to pity me, but when you are desperate, these are the questions you ask. My family is a model one, they have always given me everything I need, however, they don&amp;#39;t understand me. Every time I tell them why I think I feel like this, they just tell me that this is what I get for always isolating myself. The fact that nobody seems to truly understand me makes me hurt. I have longed for a long time for things to change. I thought that as I am becoming an adult, things will get better, however, they are not. I am also very perfectionist, and I can&amp;#39;t help but worry about anything. I hate myself for not being able to solve my problems, for being so weak when there are a lot of people living in a worse situation than mine. I don&amp;#39;t want to die, but the suffering of loneliness, and hiding my tears behind a smile makes me hurt. I also think of what would happen if I died, my mom would probably suffer the most, and that makes me not want to die. But, what about everyone else, would they cry? remember me? have good memories of me? I don&amp;#39;t want to be weak, but I can&amp;#39;t be strong either, though I tried. I want to end my suffering. If I have good grades at college, a loving family, and people surrounding me, why do I suffer so much? I can&amp;#39;t understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "z94bbz", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CamiLOL1270", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/z94bbz/i_want_to_live_but_living_makes_me_suffer/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/z94bbz/i_want_to_live_but_living_makes_me_suffer/", "subreddit_subscribers": 927660, "created_utc": 1669844739.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext": "So recently, my bf (16) has been acting very strange, he hasn\u2019t been as enthusiastic about things as he used to, he\u2019s seemed to get angry at everything and has been quite in our relationship.

Hopefully I\u2019m not getting too annoying. So, bit of background. My Italian boyfriend (41) and me (32) split a few days ago. I\u2019m abroad visiting my family and he called to say it wasn\u2019t working. He was signed off work for severe anxiety the same day. He said his head was about to explode with everything so he had to reset. We\u2019d been together 3 years and this is the third time he\u2019s split, saying that he\u2019s not fulfilled sexually. The communication throughout has been awful \u2013 he\u2019s only ever told me he\u2019s not happy sexually to leave me, never to find a possible solution to the problem. It is true that towards the end of our relationship we were only having sex once every 10 days ish, although we have had more during our relationship. When he left me, he was crying saying how he loved me and didn\u2019t want to lose me. A bit more background\u2026 he came out the closet about 4 years ago to the horror of his parents, who never accepted me. He has diagnosed depression, takes pills for anxiety and his therapist says he has severe dependency on his mother (who the therapist says he is \u201cmarried\u201d to). His mother is really miserable and hates me. I am his first partner, and his sister who is nearing 50 has never had a partner. Also, basically every area of his life seems to cause him deep unsatisfaction, which is really striking for me. Anyhow, last night, we were speaking on WhatsApp and then he called, crying. He said he was so sorry for leaving me over the phone and that he is going through a really rough patch in his life, but that I mean the world to him. He said he hasn\u2019t been satisfied with our sex from day 1, sees everything we did together (including our trips) through a filter of sadness, and that his mother has said that we didn\u2019t love each other anyone and that I could never make him happy. He also said that he knows some people are ok with a relationship which makes each person feel secure, provides them with a stable family environment, and where there is commitment, but where the sex is not 101%, and he doesn\u2019t want that. There was lots of crying and we talked about maybe giving it one more try, but he said he\u2019ll have to speak with his therapist first tomorrow. Anyway, my question is, I know it might not work out, and I\u2019m not looking for people to tell me it won\u2019t, but if we do decide to give it one last go, what change could we make to maximize our chances of success? We both love each other lots and get on well. Each time we got back together, we\u2019ve never changed anything, just hoping for a different outcome, which I think has been a mistake.

In the last 2 years I had a nervous breakdown and finally gave in and seeked help. At first I was taking Klonopin 2 to 3 times a day and it helped and as the Zoloft started to kick in , I started using Klonopin less and now only use it at night or as needed. I went all the way up to 200 mg of Zoloft and was on that for the last year and that was the only dose that even remotely helped the ocd and intrusive thoughts and panic but I was entirely nonproductive and cared less and could do nothing but sleep. I asked my phychiatrist about Adderall and it turns out by my response to it and the fact my son also has it that I have adhd as well as it helps me focus but also I can sleep all day after even taking 30mg of it and sometimes it even causes me to sleep more. I also have an underactive thyroid but my levels are okay right now. The first \"Adderall\" I took was dextroamphetamine and it helped a little with energy but not nearly enough but it has some unpleasant side effects like sweating tons like I never have. I also lost weight on that which I didn't mind lol.... But because of the side effects, I switched to name brand Adderall and then Teva, both of which somewhat expand my vocabulary and help me focus a little but do nothing for my energy levels and I sleep all day some days. I used to take Adderall twice daily 15mg each and then switched to 30 mg once a day after dropping Zoloft down to 150mg where it's still helping but some instrusive thoughts have come back again and a month or so ago after dropping down to 150mg Zoloft, I also started Wellbutrin 150mg. I take the Zoloft and one Klonopin at night as well as a 0.25 ropinirole for the most brutal thing I'm now suffering with because of the setraline and Adderall and I had this condition before as well but it's gotten a million times worse on these meds to the point where I'm truly suffering and that is restless legs syndrome. That combined with how I'm always so tired is pure torture. I hate how unproductive I've become. I also have phisical pain from other conditions and a car accident 2 years ago. I was an electrician ik construction but I have not been able to work in a couple of years now. I'm a family man and a very active father in my kids lives as they are my world although it's Definitely been tougher the last couple of years. I'm trying to find the right combination of these 6 medications including my hypothyroidism/hashimotos but I also am very afraid because of the chance of seizures which I've never had one but I keep increasing and adding more meds and so we will see what happens but I definitely do not want to have a seizure. I also have asthma and IBS and most likely rheumatoid arthritis as well and who knows what else. One more thing I'll add is that 5 hour energy drinks used to help me at work when tired some days and so every now and then I will take that as well or some other form of caffeine and I've ever tried all types of vitamin's as well at times which gets expensive when struggling financially. My situation is very complex as you can see. I know the 300 mg in a caffeine energy shot drink probably increases dangers but I am so desperate to feel more energy and sometimes that even makes me sleep and other times it gives me a slight boost. I also have 2 special needs children out of my 3 kids and one way worse then the other and he has the ocd but way worse then I did as a child with the thoughts etc. And he has a low IQ so it's hard for him to comprehend it and know how to deal with it. I'm seeing a new phychiatrist for the first time tonight (the one my 7 and 9 year old son's see for ADHD etc) and am going to discuss this all with him but he's a much much older gentleman and not what he once was probably but I will see what he says. I was seeing a psychologist for a while too until recently. I loved this video though and you seem so very knowledgeable so I'd love to hear what you would have to say about my very long comment which I apologize for but like I said my situation is very complex unfortunately. I forgot to mention that the caffeine also makes the RLS much worse and at times even if I'm not sleeping, I still can't get up because rubbing my feet together or against the sheets or anything really is addicting because it's the only relief I feel from the RLS and so I'm still nonproductive even then \ud83e\udd26.... The RLS is all day nonstop even while moving at times and I will grind my legs and feet so hard into the sheets I will get cuts or bruises or even put holes in the sheets. I'm not as crazy as it sounds here as if you met me , I can definitely have a normal conversation no problem but I'm suffering in many ways. I almost want to get off of all of it when hopefully soon the magic mushrooms become legal in my state as a treatment for anxiety and depression and I've been reading so much about that and how it helps dramatically but without the side effects but it's not legal in my state yet.

That is an international high school robotics competition, and I am a high school student. I considered posting in r/FRC but felt it wasn't right. If you have been part of FRC this post will make a little more sense. I'm doubting whether continuing robotics will be good for my mental health or for the growth of my team. \n\nI feel like we have tried our best, but have we really tried our best? Have *I* tried my best? When something goes wrong and it is unfixable at competition, and I realize what I did wrong, simultaneously I'm excited that I have figured it out and learned something but also down that it was too late, I should've tested and seen earlier. This has been a recurring issue causing my team to lose way more matches than winning and we ranked last or close to last in recent competitions. I feel like my team is underwhelmed and sad. I feel like it's my responsibility as a lead designer for the team and I don't know how to fix it. \n\nI've seen this with teammates in multiple areas spanning hardware, software, design, awards and business. I've seen them very frustrated with lack of progress and not keeping up with responsibilities, and this is just autumn so I am worried that they are not going to be ok during build season, when deadlines go by much faster. I think they take robotics way too seriously and part of why I'm very sensitive and reactive to their emotions is because I know they take it too seriously. It's just a high school competition after all and life goes on. I guess the question I'm not asking is, am *I* going to be ok during build season? I'm very afraid of failure and this is compounded by my family upbringing, my competitive school environment, and feeling like I am letting down my team.\n\nFrom my years in FRC I have learned skills like teamwork, communication, time management, empathy etc and everyone I've met is wonderful and hardworking in their own way and I am very grateful for that. But it has also emphasized how much I am lacking in those areas and the issues that has caused. This has led me to believe that you have to have a strong sense of these skills and ability to handle stress and confidence and an open growth mindset before you join FRC to start with to get the most out of it and be happy. In robotics now I'm not exactly happy, I'm not exactly sad, I'm not exactly excited, I'm not exactly focused, I'm not exactly anything. \n\nBecoming part of FRC has lead me to want to study engineering. But now I don't think I can thrive in a professional engineering environment where design flaws can have way bigger consequences and the stress of that. I know a lot of people change courses of study in college and maybe I will do that, but I wish I had taken more time away from robotics and tried out more of other interesting things like joining a band, history club, philosophy club, cinema club, fashion club, eco club.\n\nI feel impostor syndrome, that I don't think I know as much as the people on the team before me. I don't know if I am leading my team downhill because of my poor design skills and time management and inadequate training of new members. I have also heard other students and teachers at school talking about how bad of a team we are and sometimes my team can be self-deprecating which makes me unhappy because I think it's all my fault.\n\nThere are also a lot of other minor things like my other club being totally disorganized and not doing well on a test etc that are stacking up.\n\nIt would mean the world to me if anyone could leave some words of encouragement, and helpful if anyone could give me a bit of clarity on what and how I am thinking right now.

I don't really expect anyone to read it all and I'm writing it more as therapy for myself than anything else. But if anyone does read and fancies offering some advice it's very much welcome! \nSo, hi, I'm 25, woman, from the UK, and I've been suffering with bad depression and anxiety for the last few years if not most of my life. I've been on sertraline for 3 years now (which I'd like to come off) and recently started councelling. Councelling has been insanely enlightening for me and made me fully aware that my depression is self-esteem based. Even if logically I know it's not true, deep down I've convinced myself that I'm a fat, lazy, ugly failure and a broken mess, therefore I've 0 confidence in myself because I feel like I'll inevitably fail. When I do try, I'm anxious as hell. \nIt really doesn't help that I forget and lose everything. I struggle to order my thoughts and actions in all aspects of life, which often makes me feel hopeless. Even as I'm typing this, I'm at risk of losing my current agency work because I forgot my pass AGAIN and I'm on my final strike with them. Now i dont know if this scattiness is because of undiagnosed ADHD or just a symptom of my depression/anxiety, but there's that.\nI'm constantly comparing myself to others, thinking everyone else is better than me at everything; at work, at socialising, at helping others. It's a constant spiral of self-reflection and metaphorical punching  myself in the face. \nMy self-belief (or lack of it) has become a self fulfilling prophecy where I'm unable to hold a job because I have so many  nervous breakdowns at work. I've settled for doing easy agency work that's not mentally taxing at all, but is totally meaningless and soul destroying. I've only ever worked in hospitality, which I know for a fact is really harmful to my mental health, but I've been stuck in a rut, knowing I need better for myself and just not doing it. I don't even know if I CAN do anything else. But something has to change because I can barely get through a shift.\nNow after years of this, I'm finally making real steps to heal myself, and my god I WANT to be better. I WILL be better. I'm getting councelling and meditating and focusing on self care. Slowly I'm coming to understand myself a lot better and working on adapting my mindset. BUT I'm aware it's a very long and non-linear process and there's A LOT of healing to do. I'm trying to be kind and patient with myself and BELIEVE in myself. \n\nNow with all that being said, I went and got a job teaching English in Vietnam and I'm moving there  next month. It's something I've wanted to do for years, but mental health and covid got in the way. I've never tought before. I've never even worked with kids before. It's an entry level role with a respectable company, and this is pretty huge move for me.\n\nPart of me wonders what the hell am I thinking? If yesterday at work I had an anxiety attack and had to go home because I was asked to carry some plates, what on earth makes me think I can stand up in front of a class of 20 teenagers in a foreign country and teach grammar? Am I insane? \nThen there's another part of me that feels like I NEED to do this. I'm seeking fulfillment and I want to be good at this. Teaching is something I can see myself striving to improve at. I'm not just going for a holiday, but to start a new career and find some kind of purpose. I'm praying the reason I've been so anxious and depressed is because I've been dragging myself through work I hate in a country I feel totally disillusioned with. Whilst I'm nervous to leave, I'd be even more scared to stay. \nI'm aware that leaving the country isnt going to make my issues go away. They are mine and they will inevitably come with me. But if I tell myself I can do it and continue to work on myself, can I make it true? My biggest fear is getting there, standing up in front of my first class and having a total anxious meltdown and having to come straight home, having used up what little savings I've made. After all, I'm leaving behind my main support network of family and friends who I love dearly. But I don't want to believe that into happening. I want to succeed.\n\nSo yeah, any advice for a very nervous, very hopeful human, who decided to up and move to Vietnam?", "author_fullname": "t2_82mas7mn", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Moving to teach English in Vietnam, but worried my depression will win and I'll have to come home", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_yqrexg", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1668019010.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.depression", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this is a long one.

have any symptoms, so I calmed her down hugged her, gave kisses and assured her that everything is going to be okay and she doesn&amp;#39;t actually have a panic attack she is feeling anxiety attack(I said that because I know that she can get panic attacks just because she thinks she is having one).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now she is angry that I didn&amp;#39;t believe her and she says alot of bad things about me again :( .\nWorst thing is I think she is manipulating me, because she didn&amp;#39;t have any anxiety attack symptoms as well and\nthere have been these kind of situations every single day, but this is the first time when I corrected her and just said that she is not having a panic attack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did I do something wrong?\nHow do you feel when you have anxiety or panic attack?\nHow often do you have panic attacks?\nHow do you treat panic attacks?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc":

She left me traumatized (as my councilor called said) and I've been terrified of women ever since and even being just friends with women as I'm scared they would touch me or do something to me. I am straight but I don't have sex on my mind constantly, I just want to feel loved and appreciated and to have a laugh and a joke.\n\nThen after half a year she left me alone and found someone new and so did I, but when I started talking to this new girl my ex became friends with her and kept following us around and stalking me again, eventually I flipped out at her and started yelling in public and she left me alone for a few months after, however during those months the new girl told me she liked me at first and treated me as if we were together and hugged me and stayed close to me all the time and we talked all night every night etc and hung out whenever we could until suddenly she changed after she asked her parents if we could date (she's Sikh) which at first she told me we couldn't date for another two years, but when I said I was happy to wait she suddenly kept extending the time until she eventually said that she doesn't know if we was ever allowed to date, we decided to just remain friends for the mean time and see where things go from there, however she didn't change the way she acted and neither did I which made me think she was just leading me on, then prom came around and we made plans to go together but I warned in advance repeatedly that I didn't want to go due to my anxiety but I was going for her, which she acknowledged, then when prom came she turned up nearly two hours late without letting me know she was late, then proceeded to ignore me virtually the whole time I was there, whenever we did speak she seemed distant and I tried telling her repeatedly I was struggling with my anxiety and I wanted her to just talk to me and for her to comfort me, but she decided to walk away and hangout with friends whenever I brought this up, then halfway through the night I saw her with her guy friend she told me not worry about talking to him and they were laughing, which pissed me off and upset me as she'd been telling me she liked me but also she didn't as she wasn't allowed to, so I told my friends I was leaving and they had seen the way she treated me all night and said they're sorry she was rude and told me to forget about her, so I left and around 2 hours later she called me asking where I was, and I had a go at her and hung up, which apparently after she went around slagging me off to people and my friends saying I was toxic and apparently trying to spread rumours.\n\nI didn't know about this until a week later as her friend told me, which I confronted her about and at first she denied and lied about but eventually admitted and things fell apart from there as she continued to lie and lead me around in circles, she kept trying to make out that everything was my fault and that I was toxic when I tried to fix things whereas she never tried and that I should leave her, I wish I did but I know if I did I would have still been portrayed as the bad guy. She told me that she couldn't be seen with me or else her parents would start thinking things however she could hangout with her other guy friend as much as she wanted, she kept saying I was overthinking things and that I was being just too sensitive but all she did was lie to me and lead me on. \n\nWhenever we argued about small things/ mistakes she would instantly say that we were being toxic and that the relationship wasn't good for us, despite the arguments never being toxic. She fainted once on the day we finished high school as she was overwhelmed with everything going on around her and I caught her and called the teachers over, I walked her home and things were still okay between us at the time but then she ruined everything at prom. \n\nI've tried getting over her, she's the only girl I've loved and I still think about her even though I hate her for everything she's done, I'm going to the gym to try and clear my head as it silences the voices in my head and helps a bit with insecurities but my family don't help as the men on my dad's side always criticise my progress and say I'm not doing things properly and should do this and do that, despite them all being overweight, alcoholics and have never seen the inside of a gym. Then whenever I show my progress to my family I get only a few well done and that's it, they suddenly change the subject, or they say it's not fair for me to 'boast my achievement' as it makes them feel insecure about themselves. I'd virtually never receive acknowledgement of achievements or praise for my efforts from my parents for years until around a year ago when my sister and I complained to my mom's parents about never getting praise, which suddenly they starting praising but now it feels to little to late.\n\nI just feel so incredibly lonely and unhappy, I always have a smile on my face and I always try to be kind to be people and always try my best at everything but I never feel enough, I've had shit experience with relationships and I just haven't been able to catch a break, my cat had to be put down the week before my GCSEs as she had kidney failure, I was the only one who barely cried, I just couldn't as I knew I had my exams to worry about and focus on, then my mom kept asking to get a new cat pretty much straight after my cat was put down and kept asking for weeks until I finally snapped and starting yelling and swearing at her to grow up and think of others for once, she's always been incredibly selfish and childish whenever she doesn't get her own way. \n\nI know no one's perfect but I just wish my family could be more supportive and caring, my mom's side are but still have their flaws. My parents have always tried their best to provide me and my sister and now we've gotten older we've become more spoilt which I guess is there way of saying they love us and care for us but sometimes the way they act and treat us makes us feel pretty shitty, my dad always tries to push me down whenever I say something is wrong or may be wrong, he gets aggressive and snappy with me and my mom gets extremely clingy in a weird way and always wants hugs from me and my sister even though I've told her I'm not comfortable with physical touch in anyway. I love my family and I know they love me but they can be very inconsiderate a lot of the time and don't seem to care when they hurt other people's feelings. \n\nI just wish I could end things but I know I can't as it would upset my friends and family and it feels a bit selfish, I just wish I could just disappear or have never existed, I've always been told to man up and to push through the pain but there's only so much I can take.

I wasn&amp;#39;t ready to experience this feeling again. It&amp;#39;s almost like being re-traumatized.

Today got bad enough I started losing it at work... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why can&amp;#39;t I hold it together? For the sake of my mother, stepdad, and little brothers I HAVE to be strong.

I feel broken.... Like I can&amp;#39;t do this anymore..... I honestly just want to hide in a box and sleep for the next year.... Maybe then it&amp;#39;ll get better... But right now....
