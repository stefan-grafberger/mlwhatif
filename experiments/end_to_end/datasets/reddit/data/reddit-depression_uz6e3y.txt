I wanted to try out makeup, wear dresses, have long hair, have long nails, even my favorite color was pink. The way I looked was very feminine, and I was always jealous of girls, and this confused me a lot when I was 11, and made me think that I was gay, even though I was attracted only to women. This also led into me thinking I was trans, since I was a guy who had feminine interests. I eventually fell down the rabbit hole and wanted to take hrt, (at that time I didn\u2019t know the negative effects I was 12). Anyways I tried out cross dressing and was surprised how well the clothes fit and looked on me, since I had a skinny upper body. I would do it secretly in my moms closet. \n\n\n\nOnce puberty hit I kind of stopped caring about the feminine stuff. I told myself that I\u2019m supposed to be a real man. I started less and less cross dressing, because I was afraid that I was gay and tried suppressing it. I stopped cross dressing at 14. I started working out at 15-16, and got pretty big. I loved how well I looked, however I felt there was something missing. It was like I was doing it to fit into societies expectations of a man. Eventually I got very depressed, maybe I was going to hard, or maybe I was fiening for peoples attention, but I started disliking what I was doing to myself. \n\n\n\nA few months ago, I got into an accident and one of my fingers got sliced off. After surgeries and stuff, (6 months now) they reconnected the finger, and it\u2019s still healing. \n\n\n\nI had to stop working out, and I got very depressed. \u201cI won\u2019t look good anymore\u201d. I was scared that I was going to be seen as weak again. Eventually my body started becoming skinny again, and then my cross dressing urges came back. After months of suppressing it, I just decided to go by a skirt, and thigh highs, which was my dream since I was 12. I shaved my entire body for the first time, wore that skirt and thigh highs and felt so happy, it was unreal.

I wanted to try out makeup, wear dresses, have long hair, have long nails, even my favorite color was pink. The way I looked was very feminine, and I was always jealous of girls, and this confused me a lot when I was 11, and made me think that I was gay, even though I was attracted only to women. This also led into me thinking I was trans, since I was a guy who had feminine interests. I eventually fell down the rabbit hole and wanted to take hrt, (at that time I didn\u2019t know the negative effects I was 12). Anyways I tried out cross dressing and was surprised how well the clothes fit and looked on me, since I had a skinny upper body. I would do it secretly in my moms closet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once puberty hit I kind of stopped caring about the feminine stuff. I told myself that I\u2019m supposed to be a real man. I started less and less cross dressing, because I was afraid that I was gay and tried suppressing it. I stopped cross dressing at 14. I started working out at 15-16, and got pretty big. I loved how well I looked, however I felt there was something missing. It was like I was doing it to fit into societies expectations of a man. Eventually I got very depressed, maybe I was going to hard, or maybe I was fiening for peoples attention, but I started disliking what I was doing to myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I got into an accident and one of my fingers got sliced off. After surgeries and stuff, (6 months now) they reconnected the finger, and it\u2019s still healing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to stop working out, and I got very depressed. \u201cI won\u2019t look good anymore\u201d. I was scared that I was going to be seen as weak again. Eventually my body started becoming skinny again, and then my cross dressing urges came back. After months of suppressing it, I just decided to go by a skirt, and thigh highs, which was my dream since I was 12. I shaved my entire body for the first time, wore that skirt and thigh highs and felt so happy, it was unreal. I haven\u2019t felt that happy since the start of the pandemic, when I stopped cross dressing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now im 17, im fine being a guy and straight, and finally figured out who I truly am.

We used to play games, cuddle, hug and kiss each other all the time when we were together. Month later I started getting suspicious because I noticed that they were saying things about a coworker\u2019s appearance. I think that\u2019s what drew the line between us. We split two months after we started dating.\n\nThe year past and we were becoming friends again. For a second I thought we would end up back together. I even took them to my homecoming as my \u201cdate\u201d yet I later found out it would mean nothing. Fast forward to the beginning of December and I\u2019m getting ready to see their musical performance at her school because I wanted to support them. I check my Instagram and I noticed they had a post with the caption: \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9c.

Literally, what is the point? \n\nMy relationship(s) is/are becoming more difficult to maintain. They all say they understand and want to be here for me, support me. But when the big sad hits, all of the sudden they don\u2019t understand. Don\u2019t understand why I don\u2019t text back. Don\u2019t understand why I can\u2019t get out of bed. Don\u2019t understand why cleaning is dreadful. Don\u2019t understand why cooking is dreadful. Don\u2019t understand why I get so angry. Don\u2019t understand why I want to be left alone. Don\u2019t understand why I get so angry and irritated when I\u2019m not left alone. Don\u2019t understand why I don\u2019t want to be touched. Don\u2019t understand why I don\u2019t want to have sex. After all of that not understanding they claim to understand, they proceed to make me feel like shit for being so shitty. I\u2019m aware I\u2019m awful. Existing is just exhausting. \n\nIt\u2019s just so fucking lonely. My support system tries to support me but they just make me feel worse. \n\nThen there\u2019s work. It takes everything in me to get out of bed. To leave the house. Then when I do, I have to go smile and pretend I\u2019m happy for people I\u2019ll never see again. The facade is draining. Work is getting hard to maintain. I\u2019m on my third job this year. Everything everywhere makes me angry. I despise pretending that I\u2019m okay. But you have to. It\u2019s expected. \n\nThen there\u2019s my drinking and drug usage. I know that only makes my situation worse. I don\u2019t wake up everyday and abuse alcohol and drugs, but I do go out probably 2 nights a week and get obliterated. Not healthy, mentally or physically, I\u2019m aware. My boyfriend tells me it isn\u2019t helping and that I shouldn\u2019t.  Again, I\u2019m aware.

Literally, what is the point? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My relationship(s) is/are becoming more difficult to maintain. They all say they understand and want to be here for me, support me. But when the big sad hits, all of the sudden they don\u2019t understand. Don\u2019t understand why I don\u2019t text back. Don\u2019t understand why I can\u2019t get out of bed. Don\u2019t understand why cleaning is dreadful. Don\u2019t understand why cooking is dreadful. Don\u2019t understand why I get so angry. Don\u2019t understand why I want to be left alone. Don\u2019t understand why I get so angry and irritated when I\u2019m not left alone. Don\u2019t understand why I don\u2019t want to be touched. Don\u2019t understand why I don\u2019t want to have sex. After all of that not understanding they claim to understand, they proceed to make me feel like shit for being so shitty. I\u2019m aware I\u2019m awful. Existing is just exhausting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s just so fucking lonely. My support system tries to support me but they just make me feel worse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there\u2019s work. It takes everything in me to get out of bed. To leave the house. Then when I do, I have to go smile and pretend I\u2019m happy for people I\u2019ll never see again. The facade is draining. Work is getting hard to maintain. I\u2019m on my third job this year. Everything everywhere makes me angry. I despise pretending that I\u2019m okay. But you have to. It\u2019s expected. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there\u2019s my drinking and drug usage. I know that only makes my situation worse. I don\u2019t wake up everyday and abuse alcohol and drugs, but I do go out probably 2 nights a week and get obliterated. Not healthy, mentally or physically, I\u2019m aware. My boyfriend tells me it isn\u2019t helping and that I shouldn\u2019t.  Again, I\u2019m aware.

I also remembered hearing lots of clinking and glass breaking.\n\nThen not long after they separated and I went with my mom. I only remember feeling scared of her because she would get mad at the pettiest things like me accidentally spilling water on the floor. A few years passed by, and my parents decided to live in the same house again because my little brother who went with my dad started to look for my mom.\n\nAfter being in the same house, they would still fight often because they had different parenting styles and would argue a lot about how to raise me and my brother. I couldn't care more about the fights that those two had because I was already stressed from the expectation of being a good example as the first child to my younger sibling.

It was quite the experience, I was really high, 177bpm, delirium, seeing four times of everything, being unable to walk without falling, amnesia.

I cut myself and was highly suicidal, just stayed in bed all day without showering or eating, lost about 5kgs at least and I was already pretty skinny. absences were the main issue though, being an international student I had to maintain a high attendance and was at risk of being deported so I was forced to see a gp and got referred to a psychologist (stopped seeing after 2 sessions as it didn\u2019t help) and psychiatrist soon there after and further down along the road I got diagnosed with: \nMajor Depressive Disorder, Generalised Anxiety Disorder, ADHD, Borderline Personality Disorder \nwhich I call my 4 infinity stones lol&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dropped math methods in term 1 and gave up on ucat/isat and in term 3 failed physics which meant I had to pass the remaining 3 subjects - English, Chemistry and Chinese second language or fail VCE and get deported &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then exams came, I sat two of them and on my last one I accidentally overdosed on my benzos and was sent to the a&amp;amp;e. It was quite the experience, I was really high, 177bpm, delirium, seeing four times of everything, being unable to walk without falling, amnesia. My experience of it all was hazy, but I think the amnesia kind of went further than the experience and seems to have shattered my memories of 2022 into fragments. - Hence the title&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, I passed and just got my score yesterday though I definitely didn\u2019t get a perfect score and I\u2019m definitely not getting into grad med, I\u2019ll still work towards my dream of becoming a psychiatrist even if I lack motivation and happiness a lot of the time&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;relationships 2022:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;being depressed, I barely spoke to my friends though I would still hangout with them during recess and lunch albeit with a mask on (mask mandate was lifted ages ago) usually just listening to music whilst zoning out pretending no one sees me and that im all alone&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;early that year I also met my first girlfriend who\u2019s now my ex through a mutual friend and got together with her without knowing I had all these problems (wasn\u2019t a good match as she had her own problems too)\nit was a rocky relationship and didn\u2019t end well with multiple (2 serious) breakups and me threatening to suicide once and having the police visit my house &amp;lt;- first breakup (which I still regret) and saying hurtful stuff in an episode of uncontrollable rage to her friends (wasn\u2019t without reason but was over the line which I admitted and expressed my sincerest apologies to said friends)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the second breakup I handled a lot better though I was heartbroken and cried lots unfortunately for me it came during a bad time as exams were in 3 weeks. \nex then messaged me a few days before exams to apologise for getting into a relationship with me when she wasn\u2019t fully over her previous ex and for lying and saying she loved me when she never did. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t hold anything against her nor do I harbour any ill feelings towards her though we both blocked each other on every platform.

Very small old rented studio, bunch of cats, internet and books, no partner and job that would make enough to live but not necessarily career - Ideally home office. I was always unmotivated and it was my dream to go with the path that offers the least amount of work and resistance. I think it was because my ADHD, depression and BPD. I was always neutral about having kids, leaning into having them, but I always expected that I'll just sleep with some random guy, not tell him anything about getting pregnant and keep the baby (don't judge me, I was like 12, now I know how terrible this is). \n\nI was born into an uncomfortable life and a slacker, I wanted to die as a slacker in an uncomfortable life. I wanted stained carpets, yellow walls from smoking, free clothes from salvation army, visiting food pantries, having barely the amount to pay bills (and if they sometimes disconnect electricity, no big deal, that can be handled by cooking on the fire and reading by candles) eating above the sink only from paper plates so I can throw them away and never use dishes, eating pasta with ketchup or just apples and stale rice for days to not have to bother with cooking. I wouldn't particularly love the ugly smells of bad neighborhood, but I'd get used to that. I was ready for shocking pitying looks from people around. (Even now you can see that I ramble too much about it \ud83d\ude05)\n\nI am surprised no one ever called CPS on me, or took me to a psychologist, I was frequently telling adults about this dream since I was maybe 10. Definitely back in elementary school. It's baffling.\n\nThen I met my boyfriend. We've been together since I was 16, going now for seven years. He's lovely and I love what we have. But it completely changed my plans. We started reconstruction of his apartment, I started going out with him to gatherings with friends, we're talking about the possibility of having babies in the future. He's the opposite of me, he loves life, wants to travel, learn new things, improve and I admire that. People always joke that I went from hermit to family girl. \n\nThat's part of what makes me uncomfortable - everything is too nice, too expensive, too clean, too \"white fence in the good neighborhood\".\n\nBut...when life gets exhausting, or when we argue, I always dream about the plan I had when I was little - easy uneventful life alone. Sometimes I even get sort of angry and bitter about not being able to be such a fuck up as I imagined. In those moments I start doubting myself - \"Am I really cut out for this life? Won't I regret this?\" \n\nI know that it's because I want to have it easy and because I don't care much about anything despite the fact that I desperately want to.

Very small old rented studio, bunch of cats, internet and books, no partner and job that would make enough to live but not necessarily career - Ideally home office. I was always unmotivated and it was my dream to go with the path that offers the least amount of work and resistance. I think it was because my ADHD, depression and BPD. I was always neutral about having kids, leaning into having them, but I always expected that I&amp;#39;ll just sleep with some random guy, not tell him anything about getting pregnant and keep the baby (don&amp;#39;t judge me, I was like 12, now I know how terrible this is). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was born into an uncomfortable life and a slacker, I wanted to die as a slacker in an uncomfortable life. I wanted stained carpets, yellow walls from smoking, free clothes from salvation army, visiting food pantries, having barely the amount to pay bills (and if they sometimes disconnect electricity, no big deal, that can be handled by cooking on the fire and reading by candles) eating above the sink only from paper plates so I can throw them away and never use dishes, eating pasta with ketchup or just apples and stale rice for days to not have to bother with cooking. I wouldn&amp;#39;t particularly love the ugly smells of bad neighborhood, but I&amp;#39;d get used to that. I was ready for shocking pitying looks from people around. (Even now you can see that I ramble too much about it \ud83d\ude05)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am surprised no one ever called CPS on me, or took me to a psychologist, I was frequently telling adults about this dream since I was maybe 10. Definitely back in elementary school. It&amp;#39;s baffling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I met my boyfriend. We&amp;#39;ve been together since I was 16, going now for seven years. He&amp;#39;s lovely and I love what we have. But it completely changed my plans. We started reconstruction of his apartment, I started going out with him to gatherings with friends, we&amp;#39;re talking about the possibility of having babies in the future. He&amp;#39;s the opposite of me, he loves life, wants to travel, learn new things, improve and I admire that. People always joke that I went from hermit to family girl. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s part of what makes me uncomfortable - everything is too nice, too expensive, too clean, too &amp;quot;white fence in the good neighborhood&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But...when life gets exhausting, or when we argue, I always dream about the plan I had when I was little - easy uneventful life alone. Sometimes I even get sort of angry and bitter about not being able to be such a fuck up as I imagined. In those moments I start doubting myself - &amp;quot;Am I really cut out for this life? Won&amp;#39;t I regret this?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that it&amp;#39;s because I want to have it easy and because I don&amp;#39;t care much about anything despite the fact that I desperately want to. My psychologists and I talked about it and it really seems like it&amp;#39;s that sort of dream that you have as a &amp;quot;safe space&amp;quot; and that it doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean that I want that sort of life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But sometimes I have doubts.

It's been this bad the whole time I was a teenager, started when I was 10, and I haven't lived freely and I haven't been happy in a very long time. Some of the symptoms are so severe its ridiculous, like the fact that I could barely speak as a teenager due to psychomotor retardation. I'm on medication now and it's helping me considerably, but I am still suffering and I feel like I can't let any more of my life go to waste. I feel like I am going insane because I have been so numb and dissociated and I'm tired of missing out on my life. Severe anhedonia has meant I have enjoyed almost nothing for years. Aside from one week where my meds were working perfectly, I haven't experienced most emotions for almost a decade. I don't hate myself at all, quite the opposite actually, because I saw a glimpse of my personality and my capabilities when I don't have depression and I could have a great life if I could just stay that way. I probably have an IQ in the 140's and I can actually be a charismatic person and enjoy things again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm thinking of harming myself soon so people really understand how much I suffer. My birthday is coming and I would make plans to celebrate with my friends and family throughout the whole day, acting completely normal and happy beforehand. Then, the night before my birthday, I would do it right as it strikes midnight and drive myself to the hospital to not alert anybody in my family until the next morning when they find out. Everybody would wake up excited to celebrate my 21st birthday and then be shocked to hear that I hurt myself and ended up in the hospital, especially before such an important occasion. Making those plans will get everybody's attention on me before I do it and the utter shock and astonishment they feel when they find out is exactly what I want. Only such a stupefying act of violence could convey how I feel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll of it would be a metaphor for people to realize. Instead of celebrating my birthday I decided to harm myself because I don't want to celebrate time going by. I'm not truly living my life and haven't been for an incredibly long time. The more you think about it the more you realize just how strong of a point this would make. I don't feel neglected at all but I feel like this has to get across for me to get what I need. And if you understood just how severe my depression is you would see why I want to do this. It just seems like the right thing to do and it gives me hope. When I caught a glimpse of myself without depression I realized I had literally forgotten most of what it was like to live normally.

It&amp;#39;s been this bad the whole time I was a teenager, started when I was 10, and I haven&amp;#39;t lived freely and I haven&amp;#39;t been happy in a very long time. Some of the symptoms are so severe its ridiculous, like the fact that I could barely speak as a teenager due to psychomotor retardation. I&amp;#39;m on medication now and it&amp;#39;s helping me considerably, but I am still suffering and I feel like I can&amp;#39;t let any more of my life go to waste. I feel like I am going insane because I have been so numb and dissociated and I&amp;#39;m tired of missing out on my life. Severe anhedonia has meant I have enjoyed almost nothing for years. Aside from one week where my meds were working perfectly, I haven&amp;#39;t experienced most emotions for almost a decade. I don&amp;#39;t hate myself at all, quite the opposite actually, because I saw a glimpse of my personality and my capabilities when I don&amp;#39;t have depression and I could have a great life if I could just stay that way. I probably have an IQ in the 140&amp;#39;s and I can actually be a charismatic person and enjoy things again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m thinking of harming myself soon so people really understand how much I suffer. My birthday is coming and I would make plans to celebrate with my friends and family throughout the whole day, acting completely normal and happy beforehand. Then, the night before my birthday, I would do it right as it strikes midnight and drive myself to the hospital to not alert anybody in my family until the next morning when they find out. Everybody would wake up excited to celebrate my 21st birthday and then be shocked to hear that I hurt myself and ended up in the hospital, especially before such an important occasion. Making those plans will get everybody&amp;#39;s attention on me before I do it and the utter shock and astonishment they feel when they find out is exactly what I want. Only such a stupefying act of violence could convey how I feel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of it would be a metaphor for people to realize. Instead of celebrating my birthday I decided to harm myself because I don&amp;#39;t want to celebrate time going by. I&amp;#39;m not truly living my life and haven&amp;#39;t been for an incredibly long time. The more you think about it the more you realize just how strong of a point this would make. I don&amp;#39;t feel neglected at all but I feel like this has to get across for me to get what I need. And if you understood just how severe my depression is you would see why I want to do this. It just seems like the right thing to do and it gives me hope. When I caught a glimpse of myself without depression I realized I had literally forgotten most of what it was like to live normally. I can&amp;#39;t sit here and wait for months while I try different medications. I&amp;#39;m at the end of my line and I&amp;#39;ve spent so much time like this I can&amp;#39;t stand it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "zfgydn", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Entire-Pension-5499", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/zfgydn/what_will_happen_to_me_if_i_harm_myself_im_not/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/zfgydn/what_will_happen_to_me_if_i_harm_myself_im_not/", "subreddit_subscribers": 927660, "created_utc": 1670453726.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext": "Who are you, saint or bad people , leave these notions you determine the answers within, right now you have no idea who you are All these concepts are too small .The concept of a saint is futile and the concept of a bad people is also futile ,Because of these small concepts, the great inside does not see you.", "author_fullname": "t2_utefxct8", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Find Who are you?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_zevrmn", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1670401036.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.depression", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who are you, saint or bad people , leave these notions you determine the answers within, right now you have no idea who you are All these concepts are too small .The concept of a saint is futile and the concept of a bad people is also futile ,Because of these small concepts, the great inside does not see you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "zevrmn", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "w3stories", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/zevrmn/find_who_are_you/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/zevrmn/find_who_are_you/", "subreddit_subscribers": 927660, "created_utc": 1670401036.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext": "o, I had a friend group of 4 me my friend L, S, And my friend A.
