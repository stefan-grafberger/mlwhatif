I told them to stop, or else I\u2019d make a \u2018joke\u2019 about them.\n\u201cGo on then I don\u2019t care\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure? because I\u2019ll happily make a joke about ____ because I know you hate it\u201d\nThey gave the stink eye and carried on. Laughing about it. being so frustrating. \nI told the \u2018joke\u2019, which looking back was the smallest comment I could have made. I acted like it was a massive deal to say it, because I wasn\u2019t used to making jokes about others but I didn\u2019t care at that moment. \n\nThey ignored and carried on.\n\nThen a couple weeks later :\nI can\u2019t remember clearly, that person (who was making most of the \u2018jokes\u2019) was being kind of laughed at by the others. It wasn\u2019t bad compared to what said before. just saying stuff like\u2026 \u201cremember when you said _____? And now you\u2019re doing it too haha\u201d\n\nI laughed along because I was secretly relieved that they were getting a small taste of their own medicine. \n\nThen all hell broke lose lol. They turned to me and started getting really furious. They started crying and shouting at me for the joke I had made that other time. Everyone turns their heads and I tried to leave but they wouldn\u2019t stop. I was so embarrassed, because the way they exaggerated everything was loud enough for the world to hear. they were obviously lying about being embarrassed of my joke Despite having made the same \u2018joke\u2019 towards me before!! \n\nThey left crying and bringing all the attention towards themselves.  they acts like a huge baby, obviously bringing their personal problems into anger towards us. \n\nI\u2019m glad because the others sided with me, telling the attention seeker that they were in fact being extremely over dramatic. That person blamed all their personal problems on me even though I had done my best to listen to them rant on about it and give advice .\n\nThey faked their apology. Still trying to make them-self the victim and how they did nothing to deserve it, the least mean joke I could have ever made. \n\nSo now it\u2019s basically back to normal, but I am still not happy. I don\u2019t want to be with any of them, and too scared to leave. every day, I realise how much they were in the wrong and I had suffered horribly every day for months. I don\u2019t know where  else to go. Too afraid to start a conversations with anybody else. I don\u2019t look them in the eye anymore, staying away. I don\u2019t want to be chatting with someone who is willing to do that.However much I would never think of humiliating them like that oveR a tiny thing that they said to me as well.

I'm the guy in the picture that was shared on this reddit (see link above) and who designed the doll in question. I was the owner of dollorphanage.com which was a completely different website than the one that is discussed in the 4W article. My site was about designing reborn dolls and offering custom-made dolls to people who want a reborn doll. That's why I had no problem promoting my business on Facebook. It was about reborn dolls! Why on earth would I promote a website that sells sex dolls that resemble children on Facebook? Don't you think I realize that something like that would ruin me? Not to mention that my family, friends and relatives were also on FB (until they started receiving numerous threats from people!). What benefit would I have from using my real name and exposing myself like that on Facebook? That's insane. Why can't people think for themselves? There is no actual evidence in the article or proof that suggest that I'm truly the guy who sells these dolls! I had no knowledge that the 3D model that I designed was going to be used for these kind of purposes.\n\nThe truth is that I was approached by a company that wanted me to design some baby dolls for them. I only gave them the 3D models, they then clearly outsourced those files to factories who can use these 3D models as reference and apparently turned them into sex dolls. That is not my fault! And the company that approached me was called SuperHotDolls and later they made a new website that used the same name as my company. Whether they used the same name (Doll Orphanage) for their business on purpose or not, is not clear to me, but it made people think that I am somehow the owner of the sex doll site.\n\nThey did contact me after the 4W article was published and apologized about what happened. They felt bad for me and explained that they sell these kind of dolls to prevent child abuse. They have articles on their website that share data that suggests that it could indeed prevent the abuse of real children. Either way, I want nothing to do with it and I don't want to be linked to their webshop.\n\nEven my mother has received dead threats and I can't travel to certain countries because I fear that people (once they recognized me) will become just as aggressive and violent as the people in the comment section of the reddit post that was submitted here 6 months ago. I think it's sad to see that so many people here just start threatening an innocent person when there is zero evidence available that suggests that I'm truly owner of this webshop and an actual pedophile. I don't have a criminal record and all my past girlfriend were 25 years or older. In fact, the girl with me in the picture is 32 years old, she might be small, but she very much so looks like an adult. She was my fianc\u00e9e for 4 years until this articled ruined our lives. She fled back to our own country (without me) because she just couldn't handle it anymore. I lost her for good.\n\nI also don't understand why this sub-reddit allowed me to become the target of so many online dead threats. That's very irresponsible. Allowing an innocent person to become such a huge target to violence and what not, it's not okay.\n\nI checked out the 4W website (the people who wrote the original article) and all they do is spread hatred. They clearly hate trans people or anybody that doesn't agree with their vision. Their article is filled with nothing but retarded speculation, there are no actual facts that suggest that I'm indeed the owner. Again, I wasn't promoting any sex doll site on Facebook, it was a site about custom-made reborn dolls! And of course I sold some of my own designs and dolls on there, but these were reborn dolls without any sexual function. The fact that this company took my design and some of my pictures and turned the baby reborn doll into a sex doll, I cannot be blamed for that.\n\nI will absolutely one day sue them because they ruined my life. I lost the love of my life, my career (I was forced to delete my website and social media because of all the threats), my family was harassed and the list goes on and on.\n\nThis is nothing but cyber bullying and people who made me a target without having any kind of real evidence should be ashamed of themselves.

didn\u2019t care!\n\nso because of that, i was that kid who never went to guidance when i was upset because i KNEW they wouldn\u2019t care. so from 4th all the way until 11th grade i bottled everything inside. one day i decided to go, and it was then when i realized WHY i bottled everything in for so long. i knew i should\u2019ve continued the bottling!\n\nbasically last year i dated someone my first boyfriend for only 11 days (let\u2019s call him G.) and had a severe lack of self respect. after finding out he cheated on me i thought repeatedly prank calling him and his side chick would be the PERFECT revenge. this caused him to REALLY hate me. which is understandable.\n\nso one day i decided to go into guidance to vent about him. despite the fact i assumed G deserved the copious amounts of prank calls, i told the counselor what i did. and she said things like \u201cwell you shouldn\u2019t have harassed him because now he wants nothing to do with you.\u201d\n\ndespite her being right about that, it was very unempathetic, and her lack of empathy only got worse as time passed. but for some reason i was always in there venting. especially my senior year. \n\none day my senior year, i went to guidance to vent about my depression. i told her how i was just so depressed, i had no friends, and that i wanted to drop out.\n\nand she looks me in the eye and says \u201cif you drop out, you won\u2019t graduate! you got 4 more months. you\u2019ll get through it.\u201d despite the fact i\u2019ve told her the same thing several times and had even given out su*c*dal ideations to her several times in the past.\n\nso me being the insanely bratty yet depressed teenager i was, i said and i quote \u201cwell if you don\u2019t do anything about this bullying i\u2019m dealing with then there will BE no graduation for me, and i\u2019ll make sure of it.\u201d \n\ni went home that day because that was a su*c*dal ideation. my mom picked me up and i told her what happened.\n\nanother time my counselor was unempathetic but also \u2018correct\u2019 was another time i complained about having no friends and she said \u201ci can\u2019t make people be friends with you.\u201d \n\nthis was the time in my life i lashed out at anyone who upset me. i was trying to cry for help but even the meltdowns didn\u2019t do anything. i was actually getting in trouble for

everything in for so long. i knew i should\u2019ve continued the bottling!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;basically last year i dated someone my first boyfriend for only 11 days (let\u2019s call him G.) and had a severe lack of self respect. after finding out he cheated on me i thought repeatedly prank calling him and his side chick would be the PERFECT revenge. this caused him to REALLY hate me. which is understandable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;so one day i decided to go into guidance to vent about him. despite the fact i assumed G deserved the copious amounts of prank calls, i told the counselor what i did. and she said things like \u201cwell you shouldn\u2019t have harassed him because now he wants nothing to do with you.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;despite her being right about that, it was very unempathetic, and her lack of empathy only got worse as time passed. but for some reason i was always in there venting. especially my senior year. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;one day my senior year, i went to guidance to vent about my depression. i told her how i was just so depressed, i had no friends, and that i wanted to drop out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and she looks me in the eye and says \u201cif you drop out, you won\u2019t graduate! you got 4 more months. you\u2019ll get through it.\u201d despite the fact i\u2019ve told her the same thing several times and had even given out su&lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;dal ideations to her several times in the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;so me being the insanely bratty yet depressed teenager i was, i said and i quote \u201cwell if you don\u2019t do anything about this bullying i\u2019m dealing with then there will BE no graduation for me, and i\u2019ll make sure of it.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i went home that day because that was a su&lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;dal ideation. my mom picked me up and i told her what happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;another time my counselor was unempathetic but also \u2018correct\u2019 was another time i complained about having no friends and she said \u201ci can\u2019t make people be friends with you.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;this was the time in my life i lashed out at anyone who upset me. i was trying to cry for help but even the meltdowns didn\u2019t do anything. i was actually getting in trouble for said meltdowns and the people who did these rotten things to me received no punishment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable":

I went ahead and messaged her, and we became pretty good friends, her being a lesbian, and me being questioning LGBT myself.\n\nSo, this continued for a while, until I finally got the courage to meet her in person (There's gender segregation in our school, so I had to go to the first floor.) I'm a pretty introverted guy, and I have a stutter, so you can probably imagine how much of an awkward mess I was, having one of my first female interactions. She seemed pretty happy, and coped with me being awkward. Fast forward a few months, and we started playing DND, where she frequently cancelled on us, and eventually left our club to 'focus on herself and grades'.\n\nI didn't think much of this.

It didn't help that people were spreading rumors that I had a crush on her. The icing on the cake, was when she started 'fake dating' the guy that was bullying me for being an ally for the LGBT people.\n\nAnd this is where I think I may have made a mistake. I started openly talking about how I felt betrayed by her, and how she was becoming a bit of a butthole towards me. And she messaged me back, telling me that she did nothing wrong, and telling my friends; 'watch NoFox's awkward ass say that I was affected by Bully' I then had to apologize to her, because I was being pressured by my friends to do so.

Even now, when I confide in people that I was bullied as a child, many don't seem to understand. They say \"kids need to learn how to deal with it, or else they won't be able to deal with bullies in adulthood.\"\n\nOkay, um, I'm bullied far less as an adult than I was as a kid, so (for me personally) bullying seems to be a problem primarily in childhood. And if you're bullied as an adult in the workplace, the appropriate \"professional\" course of action is to go to HR, not yell and swear and fight in the parking lot and slam doors. So leaving children to \"learn how to deal with bullies\" on their own just sets them up for failure later in life when a mean coworker makes a snide remark or swears at them, and then their PTSD kicks in and they automatically react the way they learned to react to their bullies. \n\nAnd kids are told by a variety of sources that they shouldn't report bullies to the school authorities, because \"snitches get stitches.\" Which is utter bullcrap. Reporting someone for harassing or assaulting you is not snitching. It's not like witnessing someone stealing a candy bar or cheating on an exam and then telling on them. That stuff doesn't affect you personally, but bullying does. And kids should not have to keep quiet about it and accept it in shame as some perverted \"right of passage.\" If an adult is getting harassed by another adult, the victim goes to HR or the police, but if a child is getting harassed by another child, then society says that's okay, it's up to the child to deal with it. A mere child, so young and innocent and arguably more helpless than an adult! And society places that great burden on them, when they won't place it on a grown adult. I swear, maybe that's the part of our sick society which has given rise to the mass shootings of the past two decades.

Even now, when I confide in people that I was bullied as a child, many don&amp;#39;t seem to understand. They say &amp;quot;kids need to learn how to deal with it, or else they won&amp;#39;t be able to deal with bullies in adulthood.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay, um, I&amp;#39;m bullied far less as an adult than I was as a kid, so (for me personally) bullying seems to be a problem primarily in childhood. And if you&amp;#39;re bullied as an adult in the workplace, the appropriate &amp;quot;professional&amp;quot; course of action is to go to HR, not yell and swear and fight in the parking lot and slam doors. So leaving children to &amp;quot;learn how to deal with bullies&amp;quot; on their own just sets them up for failure later in life when a mean coworker makes a snide remark or swears at them, and then their PTSD kicks in and they automatically react the way they learned to react to their bullies. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And kids are told by a variety of sources that they shouldn&amp;#39;t report bullies to the school authorities, because &amp;quot;snitches get stitches.&amp;quot; Which is utter bullcrap. Reporting someone for harassing or assaulting you is not snitching. It&amp;#39;s not like witnessing someone stealing a candy bar or cheating on an exam and then telling on them. That stuff doesn&amp;#39;t affect you personally, but bullying does. And kids should not have to keep quiet about it and accept it in shame as some perverted &amp;quot;right of passage.&amp;quot; If an adult is getting harassed by another adult, the victim goes to HR or the police, but if a child is getting harassed by another child, then society says that&amp;#39;s okay, it&amp;#39;s up to the child to deal with it. A mere child, so young and innocent and arguably more helpless than an adult! And society places that great burden on them, when they won&amp;#39;t place it on a grown adult. I swear, maybe that&amp;#39;s the part of our sick society which has given rise to the mass shootings of the past two decades.

The Principal echoed the same thing even though it was the first time hearing about the hitting. The teacher said she didn\u2019t know what else to to because she has spoke to the parents but don\u2019t want to look into suspension because \u201che would only be on his iPad\u201d.

The teacher tried to pacify the situation by directly reminding Ashley about how many times she, the teacher, needed to correct or redirect his behavior which is absolutely should not be Ashley\u2019s concern. My niece has voiced she no longer tells the teacher what he does because the teacher \u201conly going to take away his recess.\u201d\nWe tried talking to the principal to change Ashley\u2019s classroom (Wednesday) but we didn\u2019t receive a callback.\nOn Thursday, Harry used a marker to \u201cstab\u201d Ashley and 2 others in the class on the back.

Meanwhile the School District\u2019s handbook policies says different on how to address these matters. As I did remind her about the policies in the handbook, I felt she was just trying to talk circles around us and had a rebuttal for any concerns we voiced. We advised her we would be contacting the superintendent, school board, and law enforcement and the principal welcome us to do so but stated law enforcement would not show up at the school. \nThe principal stated she needed to see if other classrooms (short staffed) have any available space before Ashley can be transferred.

I know they are all pretty young but i dont want this to start a pattern. Again, I dont think my son is an angel. He gets into plenty of trouble. He&amp;#39;s super shady. And when he gets into and does things hes knows he isn&amp;#39;t supposed I hold him accountable. Hes a shady little dude. But hes not  aggressive, he doesn&amp;#39;t pick on other kids and he won&amp;#39;t get physical with them. \n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When i got him in the car I told him that next time it happens  to first tell the teacher and if they start to push you or take his glasses to punch the shit out of those kids, hit them in the nose, hard. I know im not parent of the year for telling him that but what else cam i tell him?  Just take the beating and if you ignore ot they will stop. Nope. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think all of the zero tolerance policies in schools is absolute  bullshit. And most teachers dont really care.\n Especially the older you get&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there anything you wished your parents had done differently?  I know the schools wont do anything. But I want to make sure as his mom he wont have to live through hell because no one is willing to help. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Im sorry this was such a long rant and thanks for reading all of this if youve made it through. I also needed to vent I guess. It just has been breaking my heart.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "call_to_action": "", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sw9l", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "uyshc0", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "wombat_hats31", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 8, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/bullying/comments/uyshc0/was_there_anything_you_wished_your_parents_did/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/uyshc0/was_there_anything_you_wished_your_parents_did/", "subreddit_subscribers": 7766, "created_utc": 1653635152.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "bullying", "selftext": "\\[This is a story I have to tell - it contains children, bullying, guns, despair, tears, and hope - something for everyone!\\]\n\nAt my 10-year-old's basketball training this week I was chatting with other parents about what high schools we're looking at for our kids.\n\nDuring the discussion, I was asked what high school I went to and it all flooded back in an overwhelming way.

guys, he calls them rude names jokingly bc he&amp;#39;s \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08) he would snitch on people without thinking about their feelings but whenever we snitch on him, he gets mad. he brags about smoking and drinking. when my friend was venting to me because their loved one died, he made a joke about it and tried to one-up her. he bodyshamed my classmate and called me a walking corpse just because i&amp;#39;m skinny and have eyebags.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know i shouldn&amp;#39;t say these because he&amp;#39;s probably going through something at home but still that&amp;#39;s no reason to be such an ***hole!! their entire play was ruined all because of him, he kept taking his costume off and blamed his groupmates and after that when our music teacher left,

"selftext": "I just want to vent some of this because I feel that stills bothers me.I suffered long-term social exclusion and bullying.That started when I was 10-11 years old.I just finished the junior and changed to middle school,that was in a big and popular school that I got a schoolarship to study there.I was pretty anxious and nervous because I was the type of child who never went outside my neighboorhood but I wanted to make new friends.My social anxiety associated w/ my strong desire to make friends made me become very shy and quiet,kind of mute.And that makes some girls starting to teasing me about this.They would laugh and making fun of everything I said,provoke me for being quiet and shy and calling me \"freaky\",\"strange\",\"aberration\" and other things.\n\nThe other reason I become excluded was my hobbies was \"nerdy\" and \"masculine\".I was the type of girl who prefered seeing animes to romantic movies,reading mangas/HQs and books instead teen magazines,prefered skateboarding or martial arts or swimming instead ballet and that things.That makes me feel excluded between girls in conversations and everytime I made reference to boyish things (that was everything that wasn't about makeup,fashion and boybands),I was called \"freaky\" and \"odd\",specially for bullies.They also started dismissed aggresivelly everything I said,repressing me on public and making fun of me and my hobbies.In that time,when I tried to socialize w/ most of girls I was ignored.\n\nAnd I was pretty much social inept.I was the type of child who never wents outside my neighboorhood,unless some exceptions and always w/ my parents.They never let me play or sleep in friends houses,gone in a child party,I only interect w/ other children inside in school and once or twice when my mom gone w/ me in park.I was very naive and kind of awkward because of this,was makes me say things that my bullies caught and use for making fun of me in public for ashame me for being silly or when I made a clumsy thing that makes me become the joke of year.In that time,was pretty common almost all the class becoming together to start a conversation and laugh and when I started to say something,my bullies made all the conversation stop to making everyone to look for me and provoking me until I start to sttuter or said something awkward to they make fun of me and name calling me.\n\nThe worst time was when I was invited to a party of a girl who not disliked me.It was my first party without the company of my parents.I didn't know what to dress so my parents buyed my clothes (that made ppl treating me as odd).In the party I didn't knew how to popular dance of that time (again,odd).I didn't have a cellphone when all my colleagues have.That makes ppl feel unconfortable and name calling me again.In some point,the girl that invited me asked for me to get out of her party because I was \"making a mess\" in her party.Her mom called to mine to pick me and I gone for home crying.In another day,almost everyone ignored me when I try to say something or interect in some way.People avoided to sit close to me in class or in break and when I sit close of them,they gone away.When I saw everyone talking and laughing together when I was close,the other children stopped to talk until I gone.It was a pretty lonely year.", "author_fullname": "t2_8i590r3g",

class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just want to vent some of this because I feel that stills bothers me.I suffered long-term social exclusion and bullying.That started when I was 10-11 years old.I just finished the junior and changed to middle school,that was in a big and popular school that I got a schoolarship to study there.I was pretty anxious and nervous because I was the type of child who never went outside my neighboorhood but I wanted to make new friends.My social anxiety associated w/ my strong desire to make friends made me become very shy and quiet,kind of mute.And that makes some girls starting to teasing me about this.They would laugh and making fun of everything I said,provoke me for being quiet and shy and calling me &amp;quot;freaky&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;strange&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;aberration&amp;quot; and other things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other reason I become excluded was my hobbies was &amp;quot;nerdy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;masculine&amp;quot;.I was the type of girl who prefered seeing animes to romantic movies,reading mangas/HQs and books instead teen magazines,prefered skateboarding or martial arts or swimming instead ballet and that things.That makes me feel excluded between girls in conversations and everytime I made reference to boyish things (that was everything that wasn&amp;#39;t about makeup,fashion and boybands),I was called &amp;quot;freaky&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;odd&amp;quot;,specially for bullies.They also started dismissed aggresivelly everything I said,repressing me on public and making fun of me and my hobbies.In that time,when I tried to socialize w/ most of girls I was ignored.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I was pretty much social inept.I was the type of child who never wents outside my neighboorhood,unless some exceptions and always w/ my parents.They never let me play or sleep in friends houses,gone in a child party,I only interect w/ other children inside in school and once or twice when my mom gone w/ me in park.I was very naive and kind of awkward because of this,was makes me say things that my bullies caught and use for making fun of me in public for ashame me for being silly or when I made a clumsy thing that makes me become the joke of year.In that time,was pretty common almost all the class becoming together to start a conversation and laugh and when I started to say something,my bullies made all the conversation stop to making everyone to look for me and provoking me until I start to sttuter or said something awkward to they make fun of me and name calling me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The worst time was when I was invited to a party of a girl who not disliked me.It was my first party without the company of my parents.I didn&amp;#39;t know what to dress so my parents buyed my clothes (that made ppl treating me as odd).In the party I didn&amp;#39;t knew how to popular dance of that time (again,odd).I didn&amp;#39;t have a cellphone when all my colleagues have.That makes ppl feel unconfortable and name calling me again.In some point,the girl that invited me asked for me to get out of her party because I was &amp;quot;making a mess&amp;quot; in her party.Her mom called to mine to pick me and I gone for home crying.In another day,almost everyone ignored me when I try to say something or interect in some way.People avoided to sit close to me in class or in break and when I sit close of them,they gone away.When I saw everyone talking and laughing together when I was close,the other children stopped to talk until I gone.It was a pretty lonely year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null,

Like Jake didn\u2019t chill with us before but like him and Edward started to like chill with us again like last year.\n\nSo basically we all went Andrews house to chill and stuff and we were playing fifa and stuff init and randomly Chris and these lot got a knife and started to try and attack and they was recording it and stuff but then they let go started laughing and said this was \u2018\u2019 a prank\u2019\u2019 and bruv I was sitting there shaking and confused I was thinking how is this a prank man but I just brushed this off. And it was Chris\u2019s idea he made a whole group chat to do it to me. And they said in the end it was a prank and they were Pranking me.\n\nThen a few weeks later these lot \u2018\u2019pranked\u2019\u2019 me again they said they planned this weeks ago before so basically we went to some park  they took me right to the top and we got out the car went into the park this was like 9 in the evening and Chris came out and these lot started fake attacking me and just were like yh it\u2019s a prank. \n\nI was like to myself you know what I\u2019m gunna prank Chris because both of the pranks were his idea.\n\nBasically short story I had Facebook but I only ever made it for Facebook market coz I wanted to buy something and they had some decent deals there I was gunna delete it time ago but I forgot I even still had it .I went in the car with Jake and Edward and I sat in the back seat I was gunna like prank Chris pretending I was someone else who saw him at the Park \ud83d\ude05 and then like a saw I still had Facebook I was gunna delete it time ago but I forgot to do it I changed my name to Paul Richard\u2019s on Facebook but didn\u2019t do it straight away coz like he\u2019d know it\u2019s me. \n\nWe played football in a car park for like more than a hour and went and got food and I completely forgot about the prank i wanted to do. Also like Jake ages ago when we\u2019re eating in Wagamamas was like I\u2019m talking to your sister as a joke though I didn\u2019t think any thing off it and I started the same joke with Chris like I\u2019ve never seen his sister and I don\u2019t even know her name so I kept joking he even joked saying he was talking to my sister. And then like we went Andrews for like 5mins and we were still joking and Andrew said her name so I was like joking oh that\u2019s her name yh I\u2019m talking to her and even then he was okay with the joke coz he knew I was joking.then I stopped it.\n\nAfter that We went Edwards house to watch the Tyson fight. And I just kept going on my phone coz my mum was calling me and stuff and just going on it in general.\n\nAnd I dunno why yh but these lot kept asking me why are you on your phone who you talking to and Chris and Edward I dunno why just wanted to know what I was doing on their.\n\nThen these lot started making fun off my Instagram posts and stuff and I was like do you lot stalk my Instagram and both were like yh and Edward was like yeah he goes through my followers and looks at my page and Chris was like yh but I\u2019m gunna go through your followers. And then he was going through my followers and was like oh isn\u2019t that your sister in your followers list said their name and I\u2019m like yeah I thought he went on their profiles and stuff. \n\nSo basically Edward was like ages ago Like I really wanted catch you out like he was so obsessed with seeing what I was doing on my phone and he went outside and he could see my phone through the window and I didn\u2019t know init I went on Facebook completely forgot I changed my name coz it was hours ago I typed his sister name in the search thing something flashed Edward took a photo ran inside and was to Chris look he\u2019s searching your sister what the fuck and he was what the fuck and I was trying to explain my self to him but he weren\u2019t having it he didn\u2019t let me. Edwards there all laughing and shit coz he caught me out. Like why was he even looking at what I was doing he shouldn\u2019t have been spying on me like that wtf.\n\nAnd I literally apologied soo much to Chris like I\u2019ve knows this guy for 13 years I would never talk to his sister or stalk her or whatever and he just literally cut ties with me stopped being my friend so did everybody else. I\u2019m like wtf I didn\u2019t even do anything like I want going to do anything like I dunno why he reacted like this for. \n\nAnd then Andrew who wasn\u2019t even there and everybody else stopped being my friend  including Jayden aswell and they think I\u2019m this sort of guy when I\u2019m not I deleted that Facebook account coz like I said I was always gunna delete it but never got round to it. These lot and Andrew are going round telling everybody lies and shit like what am I supposed to do man I never searched the name just typed it in the search thing and how do I know he didn\u2019t go on my sisters profiles.\n\nliterally I\u2019ve been feeling soo depressed and shit like I can\u2019t sleep at night I was never gunna do anything I got so much shit going on.\n\nI\u2019ve got no friends now and I haven\u2019t hung around with anybody. My life is so shit right now. I feel suicidal time to time aswel and I just don\u2019t know what to do.

And they said in the end it was a prank and they were Pranking me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then a few weeks later these lot \u2018\u2019pranked\u2019\u2019 me again they said they planned this weeks ago before so basically we went to some park  they took me right to the top and we got out the car went into the park this was like 9 in the evening and Chris came out and these lot started fake attacking me and just were like yh it\u2019s a prank. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was like to myself you know what I\u2019m gunna prank Chris because both of the pranks were his idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically short story I had Facebook but I only ever made it for Facebook market coz I wanted to buy something and they had some decent deals there I was gunna delete it time ago but I forgot I even still had it .I went in the car with Jake and Edward and I sat in the back seat I was gunna like prank Chris pretending I was someone else who saw him at the Park \ud83d\ude05 and then like a saw I still had Facebook I was gunna delete it time ago but I forgot to do it I changed my name to Paul Richard\u2019s on Facebook but didn\u2019t do it straight away coz like he\u2019d know it\u2019s me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We played football in a car park for like more than a hour and went and got food and I completely forgot about the prank i wanted to do. Also like Jake ages ago when we\u2019re eating in Wagamamas was like I\u2019m talking to your sister as a joke though I didn\u2019t think any thing off it and I started the same joke with Chris like I\u2019ve never seen his sister and I don\u2019t even know her name so I kept joking he even joked saying he was talking to my sister. And then like we went Andrews for like 5mins and we were still joking and Andrew said her name so I was like joking oh that\u2019s her name yh I\u2019m talking to her and even then he was okay with the joke coz he knew I was joking.then I stopped it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that We went Edwards house to watch the Tyson fight. And I just kept going on my phone coz my mum was calling me and stuff and just going on it in general.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I dunno why yh but these lot kept asking me why are you on your phone who you talking to and Chris and Edward I dunno why just wanted to know what I was doing on their.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then these lot started making fun off my Instagram posts and stuff and I was like do you lot stalk my Instagram and both were like yh and Edward was like yeah he goes through my followers and looks at my page and Chris was like yh but I\u2019m gunna go through your followers. And then he was going through my followers and was like oh isn\u2019t that your sister in your followers list said their name and I\u2019m like yeah I thought he went on their profiles and stuff. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So basically Edward was like ages ago Like I really wanted catch you out like he was so obsessed with seeing what I was doing on my phone and he went outside and he could see my phone through the window and I didn\u2019t know init I went on Facebook completely forgot I changed my name coz it was hours ago I typed his sister name in the search thing something flashed Edward took a photo ran inside and was to Chris look he\u2019s searching your sister what the fuck and he was what the fuck and I was trying to explain my self to him but he weren\u2019t having it he didn\u2019t let me. Edwards there all laughing and shit coz he caught me out. Like why was he even looking at what I was doing he shouldn\u2019t have been spying on me like that wtf.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I literally apologied soo much to Chris like I\u2019ve knows this guy for 13 years I would never talk to his sister or stalk her or whatever and he just literally cut ties with me stopped being my friend so did everybody else. I\u2019m like wtf I didn\u2019t even do anything like I want going to do anything like I dunno why he reacted like this for. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then Andrew who wasn\u2019t even there and everybody else stopped being my friend  including Jayden aswell and they think I\u2019m this sort of guy when I\u2019m not I deleted that Facebook account coz like I said I was always gunna delete it but never got round to it. These lot and Andrew are going round telling everybody lies and shit like what am I supposed to do man I never searched the name just typed it in the search thing and how do I know he didn\u2019t go on my sisters profiles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;literally I\u2019ve been feeling soo depressed and shit like I can\u2019t sleep at night I was never gunna do anything I got so much shit going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve got no friends now and I haven\u2019t hung around with anybody. My life is so shit right now. I feel suicidal time to time aswel and I just don\u2019t know what to do. I just want some friends I just want real proper friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing is Jayden is getting married and he said I was going to be invited and even afterwards messaged me saying happy birthday. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn\u2019t even invite me and all the boys have been in 2 holidays since without me and Edward has been posting on his Snapchat story because he knows I still have him and he knows it\u2019s gunna make me feel jealous and sad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also like nobody has even bothered to hear my side of the story aswel which makes me even more depressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really want all of this to go away and I really want Chris to me my friend again  and everybody else apart from Jayden and Edward.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sw9l", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "uvxmw3", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Sweet-Historian-3464", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 3, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/bullying/comments/uvxmw3/help/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/uvxmw3/help/", "subreddit_subscribers": 7766, "created_utc": 1653303718.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "bullying", "selftext": "I entered high school this school year.

TL/DR at the bottom. sorry if it's not the right subreddit to use, wasn't sure where to put it.\n\nSo I just wanted to share this story and see if anyone has any thoughts/memories to share. I got a lot of the \"tell her she is attractive as a joke and laugh at how stupid she is for believing it\" bullying in school and I heard someone else's story recently that made me realise how common it is for both genders and made me feel less alone, so I want to share this story to see if anyone relates or just wants to offer an opinion.\n\nso I was part of this drama group when I was in secondary school (I'm guessing maybe 14 yrs old at the time), and there was this moment in a scene we were doing where this boy had to help me down from something I was standing on and hold me by the waist in the process. and I was very uncomfortable because I didn't want him to touch my waist (I hated being touched at all at the time), so I spoke up and they got someone else to do my part.\n\nskip to the next school day. and this boy is in the year above me. he sees me in the school courtyard, runs up to me and corners me against a wall. like he didn't actually touch me, but he sort of squatted in front of me, and kind of acted like he was rubbing his crotch on me while shouting. he was maybe 4 to 6 inches away so I wouldn't have been able to get away unless I touched him to push him away. I think he found it funny because all I had to do was push him to get away but I didn't want to touch him so all I did was ask him to stop over and over and start to get upset.\n\nthis happened every time he saw me in school between lessons for maybe a month or two, and he would literally chase me down so he could do it and seemed to enjoy it more when I tried to run away. It terrified me and I always thought it was my fault because \"if I didn't get so emotional and try to run away and cry or shout for him to please stop then he wouldn't find it funny and he would leave me alone\". it didn't even cross my mind to go to a teacher, and I think that at the time I probably thought I would be the one in trouble if I did because I had a reputation of being a tattletale/snitch at the time and the teachers didn't like me for it.\n\nand when I remembered this event today at 21 years old, I caught myself listing all of the reasons why it was my fault, that all I had to do was push him away, or just ignore him or show I wasn't scared so he wouldn't want to do it anymore.\n\nif a 14-year-old told me today that a schoolmate (especially one older and stronger than them) was doing this, then I would obviously try and get them out of that situation as quickly as possible, but nobody ever did that for me, so now I constantly wonder if something I did made it ok for him to act like that, or if he misunderstood and thought I was just playing along with the game.\n\nit disgusts me that even now I can't think about it without making excuses for him and for the teachers that didn't help, because honestly, the alternative is that he did it because he could, and the teachers simply didn't care as long as I got the work done is somehow so much worse. it's like a big part of me wants it to be my fault because then at least I can believe I was powerful enough to make it stop and powerful enough to stop it from ever happening again, and even though I want to believe that if it happened to me again as an adult, I would go straight to an authority figure who could make it stop, I wonder if I could really do it or if I would just wait till the bully got bored of me and moved on to someone else like I always had to in school.\n\nI'm not sure if I can call it sexual harassment because I don't know if there was even a sexual element to it, but it did feel like kind of like a sexual thing to me, although it had the same effect as the other instances of bullying at the time. Like it felt less about being sexualised and more about feeling trapped and useless because all I had to do was push him away but I never could.\n\nTL/DR: 14 years old. boy in the year above me finds out I don't like to be touched, proceeds to corner me against a wall and taunts me every chance he gets because he knows I won't touch him to push him away.\n\nis there anyone who can relate? any comments would be appreciated.", "author_fullname": "t2_5keil6wp", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Sexual harassment as bullying in schools - wanted to tell this story and see if people relate", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bullying", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_ula50s", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1652040900.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.bullying", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not sure it even counts as sexual harassment but trigger warning anyway.

I first met him as a friend in roll call. The first interaction I made with him is when he spoke to me in a Herbert the pervert voice from Family Guy. he told me to \"go in his van full of candy\". I didn't think much of it and thought he was just some weird kid and I minded my own business. Later on the teacher of the roll call brought 2 fish into the class and gave them their own little aquarium next to where me and my friend/bully normally sat at. One was a goldfish and the other was a black Moor. We both decided to name the Goldfish \"Fishy\" and I forgot the name of the other one. we made a good friendship and I thought he was an alright guy. After we passed year 8 I learned that my friend/bully was in the same class as me in year 9. At first we were really good friends and we got through all the work our teachers would give us for the day. we got though so much our history teacher who was that teacher you were on really good terms on made special work for the both of us because of how quickly we got though our work. He also introduced me to some good friends, who will be simply named as\n\n* Friend 1 (F1): She is a likes to read a lot, is shy and is the leader of our friend group.\n* Friend 2 (F2): She is also shy and the most quiet but sparks up when she interacts with F1 she is F1's best friend.\n* Friend 3 (F3): He is a history nerd, we both get along and share a common interest about WW2.\n\nMy friend/bully tends to make very inappropriate comments about my ethnicity. so here is a list of things I remember off the top of my head:\n\n* I am referred to as \"small Asian boy\" and \"Asian slave\"\n* He will talk about the Tiananmen Square Massacre\n* jokes that I work for the Chinese government\n* repeatedly says I have a \"small penis\" simply because I'm Asian\n* will say that I eat dogs/cats\n* talks about me coming from China when I have never gone there before and refuses to listen to me trying to explain where I really come from.\n\nWhile we were friends we would say these and I didn't do anything to stop this behaviour which I really regret and I also added him on Discord (big mistake). On Discord he messaged me \"sex\" 11 times using  boxes like this:  \u2588  to make a text or image. One time we were in a call he head the voice of my mother in the background and Loudly yelled \"Your mom is hot\" and later messaged me that my mom should make an Onlyfans so he can beat his meat to my mom (WTF) and he has sent me a lot of rule 34. and one time he told me to join a discord server about mental health. He repeatedly spammed me to join because I am apparently \"insane\" I eventually succumbed to his demands and I joined the server and the VC. When I did some guy in the VC started talking about our existence and the God. He wasn't preaching about God and being saved, no, he talked about just questioned what is god in a scientific way I guess. I left and he spammed me saying I was disrespectful and very rude. One time we were discussing modding Minecraft and I invited him to a modded Minecraft server I play on with some online friends. The moment he joins he talks about how bad our base is and how he could do such a better job. He then enters my online friend's room, steals his armour that was on an armour stand, (for those who don't know an armour stand is just used to display armour) and tries to kill my friend's dog/wolf. He was quickly banned from the server. The next day after that incident he tells me I was being very rude and disrespectful again. When I talk about all the things he had just done in the server all within the first 10 minutes of joining the server he justifies his actions by saying \"it was a joke\". we eventually ended our friendship and I noticed he became more aggressive. He started saying:\n\n\"shut up\" (randomly to me even if im not saying anything)\n\n\"no one loves you\"\n\n\"you have no friends\"\n\n\"you should kill yourself\" (I believe he has said this twice)\n\nHe will say these things as well as his racial comments almost every day I come into contact with him. I try to avoid him but he comes to me. I like to be with my group of friends which consists of me, Friend 1, Friend 2 and friend 3. He will occassionally come in and say these things to me and start trying to talk with friend 1 constantly. One time while I was talking with friend 1 he comes in behind me and pushes me away from friend 1 and interrupts us. Because he has a crush on friend 1. He has repeatedly said to Friend 1 that he thinks she's hot for a few weeks and soon after she showed no interest he showed his true colours. He would start making very sexist comments to friend 1. I recall him saying to her:\n\n\"go back to the kitchen\"\n\n\"go make me a sandwich\"\n\nhas tried to take books friend 1 is reading and goes through the pages and reads in a mocking tone\n\nThe constant way he treats me has sometimes caused me to get upset and I sometimes take out my anger against my friend/bully by at one point trying to slap him on the shoulder (it's not very strong because I'm that skinny Asian kid), I have retaliated by also using the same small dick jokes he uses against me. The times I lose my cool are quite rare but over time I have noticed I have a harder time being able to tolerate and compose myself when I have to deal with him. I notice I have become a bit more violent. Fortunately before I do something I might regret I realise I have lost my temper and if I am in the middle of an action I try to not hurt him. For example when I got upset I used a soft material to lightly hit him on the head. Which doesn't hurt him. He has done things like this to teachers and school as well.\n\n* he sometimes get in trouble with teachers when they catch this type of behaviour but he's normally left off the hook\n* he has photoshopped the IT teacher next to Hitler which I think got him suspended for 2 weeks (I was really happy for those 2 weeks)\n* He has used inspect element and changed the website of the school to look like it was a Nazi re-education camp where students are gassed.\n* has said racial slurs, sometimes really close to teachers and isn't punished while another student who did the same was punished.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSometimes he is also nice to me. Some days he insults me and becomes really racist and the next he can be nice to me. Sometimes we can actually have a nice discussion and talk about things.\n\nHe makes me question my sanity. And the things he says to me keeps me awake at night when I try to go to sleep. Fortunately I have an art class which I really enjoy and my art teacher also works as the left education teacher. We do 5 minute meditations and it really helps and comforts me when I deal with my friend/bully. I have never told any teachers about how he treats me because a small part of me still wishes the best for him, I still try to treat him nicely and I am very very confused when I deal wit him. Is he a friend or foe? That small part still sees his as a friend and I cant bring myself to tell any teachers about what he does. So if I cant bring myself to do any action I guess I'll just have to rant about it on Reddit and hope I can get some useful advise on my odd situation.

He doesn&amp;#39;t, unless it&amp;#39;s junk food or it doesn&amp;#39;t taste disgusting. Pretty normal for a picky eater like me, but he wouldn&amp;#39;t finish or eat much. One time it was his favorite food. Cheese bread! He really wanted to eat it but a girl, took his bread and licked it in front of his face. He started crying. Most people would say &amp;quot;big deal! It&amp;#39;s just bread!&amp;quot; But he doesn&amp;#39;t eat much and the cheese bread was his favorite food. And he would eat and finish it.  Everybody including, who was his friends and he was the most praised in the class because he was the short, nice, softie kid. Everybody started yelling at her. And the BULLY. Of the class. The KID who always yelled joe mama or moan, started defending the skinny kid. Which I&amp;#39;m gonna call Pheng cause that&amp;#39;s his name and I do not want to say skinny kid anymore. Soon everybody was defending for Pheng. Then the bully called her the b word and she stand up on the table and started smacking him in the face and pulling his hair. He didn&amp;#39;t fight that girl back. He told the teacher about how the girl stole the bread but the teacher surprisingly said &amp;quot;its bread. Why are you crying over bread.?&amp;quot; Then some annoying kid named Josiah, who I hated forever, joined the fight without knowing reason and started attacking The bully. He, She, and the BULLY were sent to the office, and before I left school, I saw the girl crying, and the large fat kid Josiah whining, and the bully smiling and laughing. She didn&amp;#39;t come back to school for a few weeks, nether did the fat kid. however the Bully, Nick was getting praised by Pheng and other kids a lot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sw9l", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "ugc38p", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "slaughtererrrrr", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 3, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/bullying/comments/ugc38p/sometimes_the_bully_isnt_always_the_bully/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/ugc38p/sometimes_the_bully_isnt_always_the_bully/", "subreddit_subscribers": 7766, "created_utc": 1651447166.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "bullying", "selftext": "I am terrible at giving directions or asking others to do a task.
