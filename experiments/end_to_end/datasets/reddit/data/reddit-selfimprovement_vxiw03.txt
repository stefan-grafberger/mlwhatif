More or less?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I said less and literally my whole family went ape crap and straight up said no and I was just standing there like \ud83e\udd14.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like what in Gods name are my parents trying to tell me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m probably just overthinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that bizarre discussion really made me feel like I\u2019m missing some kind of knowledge that I need as an adult which is giving me anxiety at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like I\u2019m missing a lot of things that I need to know about living out and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll learn all of it and overcome my weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just wish that schools taught each individual student in their own learning style that way they will actually remember things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just feels like the only thing that schools tell students to do is get good grades which is just pure cancer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Schools(especially middle schools, high schools, and colleges), are such trash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But yeah I should probably email my teacher sometime and tell her about my anxiety because I guess she can help me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She is after all teaching me bills and budgeting because that\u2019s part of my IEP.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m not sure if any of you know what that is though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be honest I feel like everyone is greedy and lazy in this generation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also feel like money is only used as a tool and that people tend to not understand it\u2019s value.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But yeah I would honestly like some help.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmbm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "u9y2im", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ThadFTTG", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfimprovement/comments/u9y2im/im_not_quite_sure_if_ill_be_able_to_live_out_on/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/u9y2im/im_not_quite_sure_if_ill_be_able_to_live_out_on/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1352066, "created_utc": 1650691039.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfimprovement", "selftext": "Okay so as a 19 year old male who still lives with his parents.\n\nMy family started having a random conversation regarding politics and I just simply said that I don't have a side and just don't care so that I could avoid drama.\n\nI don't necessarily remember everything he said but I think my Dad said that once I'm out on my own, I will \"need\" to donate some of my money to a side (democrat or republican) or something like that and I got super confused because I just thought that you can just elect if you wanted to and that was it.\n\nSo do I really need to pick a side, because I don't really trust any of the presidents.

A lot of people misconstrue bad people as people who are distant and hostile. I think distance and hostility are the two most honest human behaviors. Every time someone is being distant or hostile you know what they do or don't want. Usually they don't want anything from you other than for you to go away. It's not friendly but it's honest.\n\nNow let's take the complete stranger who you just got introduced to, or worse yet, has approached you out of the blue. This person gives you a gift and a compliment. More often than not the gift is a soda or something of equivalent value, and the compliment is hollow and thoughtless. People look past those details so often and just pay attention to the fact that a stranger did a random act of kindness. Real random acts of kindness are extremely rare and if a stranger is being excessively kind to you for no reason, they almost always want something.\n\nThey're not going to ask you for it right away, they might not even know what they want yet. They might just be putting the building blocks in place so if you happen to have something they want they're on good footing with you.\n\nThe key thing to read into here is they want something from you, but instead of asking you for it, or offering a trade, they're not telling you what they want right away and trying to get on your good side. This is because the thing they want is either not something you want to give up for any reason, or they don't want to make a fair trade for the thing they want. They want to give you small gifts and compliments and receive something extravagant in return.\n\nThey might want sex, money, or maybe something less obvious. Maybe they want you to fight their battles for them so they don't have to do it themselves. It could literally be anything, but be assured that if they're not telling you what it is, it's not something you want to give up.\n\nThese people are pervasive throughout society, a lot of them are druggies and inmates, but you'll also find lawyers and surgeons behaving like this. \n\nEvery time a stranger has approached me with a gift and a compliment they've been an irrationally self centered predator. The best thing to do when you find someone like this is to keep your distance and don't give them what they want. If you give them what they want, you're going to encourage the behavior more. Don't start a problem with them because they're going to put way more effort into coming out on top than you are.\n\nIf someone approaches you with a gift and a compliment, stay the fuck away.

to start becoming a man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 1 \u2192 Go look at yourself in the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look at yourself as other people see you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look at your accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look at your failures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look at your financial situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look at your family\u2019s financial situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See what you can improve on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See what you need to work on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As per John 1:8.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\u201cIf we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\u201d&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So realize that you have mistakes and write them down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Journal about everything you need to improve on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Write down exactly what you need to fix in your life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 2 \u2192 Delete all distractions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you haven\u2019t already heard social media is destroying your mental health.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As per Thales.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cA healthy mind equals a healthy body.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if your mind is weak your body will be too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A strong man doesn\u2019t need any distractions like Instagram, TikTok, or such apps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go and delete them and start a dopamine detox.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A dopamine detox is a period you take off all instant gratification.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instant gratification is the pleasure you feel or the dopamine you get when you do a certain task.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These tasks are the ones you can do in a couple of seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is why it is instant, the task gives you gratification at the moment but in the long term, it doesn\u2019t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those tasks can be social media, pron, Netflix, eating fast food, or processed sweets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get rid of those addictions that are distracting you from your goals and start fresh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 3 \u2192 Surround yourself with like-minded people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Start connecting and networking with people that are on the same wavelength as you are. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One place that is the most common for this is the gym.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone who goes to the gym goes there for the same reason.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So find people that have the same goals as you have in order to push each other.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are in a friend group that doesn&amp;#39;t support your goals \u2192 leave.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 4 \u2192 Do the hard things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have the plan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The vision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The goals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go and check off each goal one by one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It will take time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you need to pull through it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For your sake and for the sake of your family.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "8723247e-1e96-11ed-94d7-0eabd5e537a3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmbm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#ffb000", "id": "zkdgmd", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JovanMiljkovic", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 26, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfimprovement/comments/zkdgmd/123_start_now_how_to_become_a_man/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/zkdgmd/123_start_now_how_to_become_a_man/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1352066, "created_utc": 1670883438.0, "num_crossposts": 1, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfimprovement", "selftext": "I got my FIRST GIRLS PHONE NUMBER today.

Then I realized what was ACTUALLY going on. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought of these guys as my friends, and so I love sharing my progress on making money, fitness, and becoming overall better than I was before because I&amp;#39;m proud of my accomplishments and I thought they would be too, and hoped to inspire them to do the same. Instead they hated the fact that I was leveling up while they couldn&amp;#39;t find it in themselves to change for the better, so instead they felt better bringing me down to their level. I got into an argument with one of them a while ago and he cut me off, and the rest of the group followed. But without them around it&amp;#39;s just one less distraction. If you know people like this in your life, do yourself a favor and cut them off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: My &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; were massive losers, and they hated me for being proud of my self-improvement and the progress I was making. They cut me off and that ended up being a massive favor for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "daf40582-1e96-11ed-a26c-aad6fb65f35d", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmbm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "id": "z9lfhx", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SandwhichesAreGood", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 34, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfimprovement/comments/z9lfhx/my_toxic_friends_cut_me_off_a_while_ago_and_im/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/z9lfhx/my_toxic_friends_cut_me_off_a_while_ago_and_im/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1352066, "created_utc": 1669893921.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfimprovement", "selftext": "(18M) I\u2019m not going to lie, I\u2019m a good looking guy and have had lots of opportunities to date girls etc but every.single.time I\u2019ve messed it up because I\u2019m just so nervous all the time when talking to girls.

She was great, no complaints personality wise. The whole time I was getting to know her I was thinking to myself \"please let her have nice feet\" . I felt intense anxiety. Well, I finally saw them and...she had bunions. My ocd went crazy. I went on a spree looking up pornstars feet trying to compare and convince myself that I can be attracted to her. Now at the time I had no idea that I had ocd, so I wasn't aware I was doing compulsions. It was terrible. Well, I broke it off with her. It was embarrassing. I obviously couldn't tell her, my parents, or her parents why I broke it off. I left it at \"there was no chemistry\", which was BS. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been scarred since then. I've talked with hundreds of girls since then. My parents would show me pictures of girls interested in marriage,. Most of these girls however, do not have pictures showing their feet. I would try to find some, just to make sure they aren't flat footed or have bunions.I would rush to look them up on Facebook or Instagram. Sometimes, they have a picture but the angle doesn't make it ideal.  If I can't confirm, I would reject trying to talk to the girl outright. Otherwise, I'm risking getting deep and having a repeat of my engagement. And its not like I can just ask the girl outright without looking like a perverted creep.  This would raise my parents eyebrows, because I would turn down attractive girls. I always make up some stupid excuse why. If I could just confirm a girl has nice feet, I can really commit to getting to know her as a person. Thats why its frustrating. I'm a nice guy, I have good social skills. I have a great career.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am seeing a great therapist, but I'm too embarrased to tell her all the details. I haven't mentioned the foot thing to her. I just tell her im picky about looks, like nose and body. I figured I can get the benefit of therapy without embarrassing myself with ethe details. I asked her whats wrong with me. Her and another psychiatrist say I have classic ocd. No personality disorders or anything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince 2 years,I have given up porn. I've been watching it since 18, with a lot of foot fetish stuff. I realize the damage this has probably caused and I HATE porn because of it. I don't know if this was the root cause of my issue or just an exacerbation of my ocd.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy biggest fear is I will end up alone because of this. This really is my biggest obstacle.

I'm still attracted to faces, breasts, butt like a \"normal person\".I can't talk to anyone about it, which is why I'm posting here. If anyone can offer me any advice I would really appreciate it.

No amount of therapeutic effects provided by music can usurp the power of absolute silence. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Too much music can be detrimental to your performance. If you find yourselves listening to music on loop for hours, maybe it\u2019s time to reassess and reduce external stimuli for your brain. This is definitely an unpopular opinion from me. Please do not follow this advice if you suffer from ADHD&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived":

This step is improving your mental health. I'll make this as quick as possible for people who want the TLDR and I'll make more posts often as time goes on so I can have better and more concise thoughts for each topic I'd like to share. I want to help people on this sub for the sake of improving my empathy and communication skill. \n\nWhat is Mental Health? Mental health by definition is \"a person\u2019s condition with regard to their psychological and emotional well-being.\" An easier way to put this is, the way you think + your emotional state.\n\nWhy should you improve it? I believe that improving your mental health is the best first step toward self-improvement for so many reasons. From firsthand experience, every single part of my life has improved since focusing more time into the wellbeing of my mental health. I have began talking to my parents more when honestly I never talked to them that much, I have been able to figure out which friends I should value and the friends I need to remove from my life, and most of all I've been able to be faced with extremely difficult hardships and look at these hardships with nothing more than gratitude and confidence. Improving your mental health will allow you to take the first step toward overall improving your life. \n\nHow should you improve it? There are a multitude of ways to improve your mental health, I'll list some as I don't want to take too much of your time!\n\n1. Fun projects- In other words an exercise with an objective that you need to carefully focus on or plan to complete. I always recommend people to do something that requires you to build some kind of furniture or decor for your room. You gain a lot of benefits from doing this as you get to wake up in the presence of something that reminds you of your hard work and focus, you most likely bought the materials to start the project; so you feel the need to commit as you don't want to waste your money, and they a very good exercise for improving your attention span/focus.\n2. Gratitude meditation- Close your eyes and think of every single individual person in your day to day life and even some you see/talk to once a week. Think about everything they provide you and why you are very grateful for them. If you think of somebody and they seem to have more negatives rather than positives... you should rethink your friendship with them.\n3. Focusing on VALUE- You should acknowledge that you, yourself are amazing for even ATTEMPTING to begin this journey. Less than 1% of people on earth have attempted self-improvement. You are special. Value doesn't just mean yourself though. You should focus on the value of your friends. Do your friends go to the gym? Do they encourage you and remind you that they love and appreciate you? Do they only speak good of people who aren't present? etc. you get the point! Ask yourself questions like these in reference to the values you hold and what makes somebody a good person and reflect upon your answers.  Usually I ask myself, \"is \\_\\_\\_\\_ a good person?\" If I can't answer yes instantly, then they most likely aren't. This is EXTREMELY important, as you yourself are the average of the 5 people you are closest to. I would also suggest valuing your time a lot more. If you don't need to work 5 days a week, reduce your days to 3 and use the other two to work on projects, school, mental health exercises etc. If you feel like when you go out with your friends you aren't doing anything but wasting your time, then don't. Valuing your time is very important not just for your mental health, but maintaining healthy relationships with others and also gaining the respect of others. You should act as if your time is valued $30 an hour, so try to use it doing something that'll improve yourself or others around you.\n4. SLEEP 8-9 HOURS A DAY NO MATTER WHAT!!!! GET YOUR SLEEP!!!! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading this guys and I'm always open to any chats in regards to mental health :)", "author_fullname": "t2_9bqbfe1b", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "WHY IMPROVING YOUR MENTAL HEALTH IS THE FIRST AND STRONGEST STEP.", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/selfimprovement", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_u7xbwf", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1650463602.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.selfimprovement", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, I&amp;#39;m a 20 year old kid who&amp;#39;s relatively new to self improvement in comparison to most people I&amp;#39;ve seen on it but I want to seriously acknowledge the best first step to entering self-improvement, although it&amp;#39;s certainly not the only one.

Mental health by definition is &amp;quot;a person\u2019s condition with regard to their psychological and emotional well-being.&amp;quot; An easier way to put this is, the way you think + your emotional state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why should you improve it? I believe that improving your mental health is the best first step toward self-improvement for so many reasons. From firsthand experience, every single part of my life has improved since focusing more time into the wellbeing of my mental health. I have began talking to my parents more when honestly I never talked to them that much, I have been able to figure out which friends I should value and the friends I need to remove from my life, and most of all I&amp;#39;ve been able to be faced with extremely difficult hardships and look at these hardships with nothing more than gratitude and confidence. Improving your mental health will allow you to take the first step toward overall improving your life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How should you improve it? There are a multitude of ways to improve your mental health, I&amp;#39;ll list some as I don&amp;#39;t want to take too much of your time!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fun projects- In other words an exercise with an objective that you need to carefully focus on or plan to complete. I always recommend people to do something that requires you to build some kind of furniture or decor for your room. You gain a lot of benefits from doing this as you get to wake up in the presence of something that reminds you of your hard work and focus, you most likely bought the materials to start the project; so you feel the need to commit as you don&amp;#39;t want to waste your money, and they a very good exercise for improving your attention span/focus.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gratitude meditation- Close your eyes and think of every single individual person in your day to day life and even some you see/talk to once a week. Think about everything they provide you and why you are very grateful for them. If you think of somebody and they seem to have more negatives rather than positives... you should rethink your friendship with them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Focusing on VALUE- You should acknowledge that you, yourself are amazing for even ATTEMPTING to begin this journey. Less than 1% of people on earth have attempted self-improvement. You are special. Value doesn&amp;#39;t just mean yourself though. You should focus on the value of your friends. Do your friends go to the gym? Do they encourage you and remind you that they love and appreciate you? Do they only speak good of people who aren&amp;#39;t present? etc. you get the point! Ask yourself questions like these in reference to the values you hold and what makes somebody a good person and reflect upon your answers.  Usually I ask myself, &amp;quot;is ____ a good person?&amp;quot; If I can&amp;#39;t answer yes instantly, then they most likely aren&amp;#39;t. This is EXTREMELY important, as you yourself are the average of the 5 people you are closest to. I would also suggest valuing your time a lot more. If you don&amp;#39;t need to work 5 days a week, reduce your days to 3 and use the other two to work on projects, school, mental health exercises etc. If you feel like when you go out with your friends you aren&amp;#39;t doing anything but wasting your time, then don&amp;#39;t. Valuing your time is very important not just for your mental health, but maintaining healthy relationships with others and also gaining the respect of others. You should act as if your time is valued $30 an hour, so try to use it doing something that&amp;#39;ll improve yourself or others around you.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;SLEEP 8-9 HOURS A DAY NO MATTER WHAT!!!! GET YOUR SLEEP!!!! &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading this guys and I&amp;#39;m always open to any chats in regards to mental health :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmbm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "u7xbwf", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PaperVirtual8054", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 13, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfimprovement/comments/u7xbwf/why_improving_your_mental_health_is_the_first_and/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/u7xbwf/why_improving_your_mental_health_is_the_first_and/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1352066, "created_utc": 1650463602.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfimprovement", "selftext": "I do say racist things but I do not mean them in any way.
