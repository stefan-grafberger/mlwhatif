like a father to me). We happened to see a shop dedicated to anime figures and cosplay items, and I happened to buy myself a maid dress. I went next door to Hot Topic and bought some thigh highs, leg garters, and a fluffy cat ear headband.\n\nWhen I got home that night, I tried everything on. Because of Asian sizes being different, I had to get a 3XL for a dress size. I also wanna preface this by saying that the dress was designed to be form fitting in a \u201csuggestive\u201d manner.\n\nI thought I looked pretty kickass, my friends loved it, and I felt confident in it. So the next day I posted a picture of myself in said maid dress on Twitter.\n\nWithin a few hours random users I barely knew began harassing me and calling me \u201cfat\u201d and \u201cbutterball\u201d. I was in a discord vc with my friends when this happened, and many of them quickly defended me.\n\n(Context: I own a discord server for me and my friends, and had a public link open on my twitter page)I happened to look up at the lobby channel where new members show up, only to see my server get raided by some of these twitter users. They immediately began harassing me and saying I was morbidly obese. I had an anxiety attack, my friend stepped in and banned all of them, and I took down the initial tweet.\n\nWhen I calmed down, I explained the situation on Twitter and concluded by saying \u201cunless you are a doctor or dietician it is not your place to call someone \u2018fat\u2019 or unhealthy.\u201d Later on a mutual of mine commented, saying I deserved the attack. Deeper digging into the matter revealed that this same user had reposted a picture of myself, saying \u201cOMG he looks so fat in his dumb dress, I want to punch him in his fat fucking stomach\u201d\n\nFurther investigation revealed that my picture had been revealed to a side of Twitter, called \u201cedtwt\u201d. From what I saw, it consisted of users between the ages of 14 and 19, all living with eating disorders of some kind. I went through the initial poster\u2019s account(gxrekitty) and found a post of them uploading my picture and taking rips at it. The comments and quote retweets were just a wall of these edtwt users saying omfg he looks so gross there\u2019s no way he\u2019s healthy, etc. \n\nI am a 5\u20194\u201d transgender male that weighs 140 lb. I consider myself a healthy weight for my age, and it was pretty degrading, seeing these users forcing their own unhealthy ideals into others.\n\nLater that day, while in call with some friends, I came up with the idea of posting a picture of a bento box I ordered and captioning it \u201crepost to scare off edtwt\u201d. In retrospect it was probably a bad move on my part, as I didn\u2019t know the entirety of edtwt was split in half, one half being members using it to cope and recover, the other half being toxic teenagers that fat shame anyone and make threads of fat people in the hopes of motivating themselves to stay skinny. \n\nWithin minutes I had users telling me to kill myself, that I was a fat bitch, a f@g, a diabetic cunt, etc.\n\nThe next day my phone number got leaked. I had to shut off my service for a few hours to get some peace and quiet. I deleted the bento box picture and began blocking and reporting users. Many of the reports failed, so I made a tweet of all the harassment that happened, including screenshots and usernames. Later on I began getting attacked for \u201cexposing my followers to triggering content regarding edtwt\u201d.\n\nFirst off, you made those harassing posts on a social media website while using a public account. Literally ANYONE could have clicked on my post and seen those tweets. YOU exposed YOURSELF.\nSecondly, I NEVER KNEW THIS SIDE OF TWITTER EXISTED UNTIL YOU ATTACKED ME. \nThirdly, much of the content posted was graphic and disturbing. I\u2019m not even talking eating disorders, there were graphic photos of self harm and wrist cutting. If anything YOU are endangering MY following by exposing yourself.\n\nI reuploaded the pictures of my maid dress to twitter, captioning it \u201creposting because I\u2019m not gonna let some kids ruin my vision of my body\u201d. IMMEDIATE harassment again, with users telling me to kill myself, calling me a fat bitch, and saying I did it to myself.\n\nI let myself get into a dangerous spot mentally and made a \u201clast tweet\u201d, and many users were encouraging me to commit suicide. I deactivated for a few hours and just tried to pull myself together. Members of my server were panicking and messaging and calling me because of how messed up I let myself get.\n\nWhen I reactivated I immediately began clearing out my notifications and blocking users and filing reports.

This is going to be a pretty distubing post for some people on the sub,so I marked it as nsfw just for saftey reasons. I made the decision to speak about this, and also conscious for the backlash I will get,but I think it's important.\n\n  A bit of a backstory about me..when I was pretty young my parents got divorced and I was back and forth staying between my mom and dad. My father used to throw these parties around the house where many women would come and get drunk,sometimes half naked and I got to witness some of it at a young age,so idk if that ducked me on the long term or not. He was pretty much destroyed by the divorce and both couldn't come to an agreement,so he started to drink, slept randomnly with other women,but otherwise was pretty chill to me and never scolded me. My mother on the other hand was very posesive about me, yelled and screamed at me,especially when I started first year in highschool , and often slapped me when I skiped school,get bad grades and came home late. Both my parents never really said they love me, they mostly give me money,but offered no emotional support. So,to put things into perspective, for an american we were pretty low income,but for my country we were pretty rich compared to others. So I guess you could say I was the \"spoiled popular girl\" in a kind of way in highscool and middleschool. I got many orbiters because of money. I got a lot of fake friends also,who I considered real friends back then and used to treat them stuff, give them money for drinks and payed their entrances in clubs,restaurants,caffees,etc and many times they still talked behind my back with jelousy and expected me to take care of them in that way. I got drawned into a circle of major assholes for a time( my fault) ,but at the time I didn't saw it like they were behaving bad. \n\nSo, to stay on track,about bullying. I mostly bullied guys I liked, because that was my only way to form a connection with someone, I thought that through sounding \"aggresive\" to people/acting entitled or teasing people the result interaction from that was going to be a genuine one and less superficial,because things can't go worse from there and they won't say \"oh I thought you were nice,but turned out to be such a dissapointment and a bitch\". I wasn't agressive physically,because I hate actual violence,but how do you call them.. micro agressions, being a brat, making insensitive jokes,etc. I have two stories in my history on reddit about some of that,so I don't want to be too long with details. With girls, I was more of a bitch and made some insensitive remarks to some girls who were overweight. I got friends with a girl,wich I will call her \\[C.\\] who was more a typical bully ( ofc I didn't see it like that back then) and I generally liked her no matter is she was bad,I defended her actions a lot, she was also the first girl I kissed also and made me thought about my sexuality (me being bisexual). I also tried to stop her and the other boys from picking on people when I saw things got out of hand and they were really hurt. \n\nFor example, there was this overweight girl who people in my class used to pick on. At first I participated by allowing this and laughing with them,but then they wouldn't stop. This girl,C. had a particular way to bully,she liked to flip a girl's hair while mocking them, so one day the girl started crying. I felt empathy for her when she did, I so tried to calm her down,but they were still going so I thought how can they not see this or feel sorry for her. Then, I was scared they might turn against me if I defended her, so I just told them \"I'm bored\" and went out of the class. I also lied for C. in another matter ( I wrote about that in another post) for her not to get in trouble with the teacher. And yes,I know my blame in all this,it's not like I don't see it or try to excuse myself. I know what others did and I know what I did also. Me and also C apologized to her in the end,but she said she can forgive us in time and we left it like that. After a while we became friends,me and her and she says she forgives me but not C. When she said that, I felt scared because I was forgiven, I wanted to be scorned and for her to hate me,because that way, I knew her feelings about me were genuine, idk.. it's all crazy how I felt. I started to weap/cry a bit and she hugged me and I felt I was going to throw up literally,because I felt I didn't deserve this and this is hurting me, I felt suffocated and had a panic attack right there ,but she was like chill to me and understanding throughout highschool. \n\nThings also got very out of hand in one case. It's ironic in a dark way, but one time there was this classmate who was the biggest asshole around, I will call him \"Bob\", bullying a guy whom I bullied a bit and also liked. So, we were at a school festival and I was teasing this guy back and forth ( I will call him Michael), we being micro agressive to each other, but we were doing it ironically so nobody got upset for real. He called me a bitch,and I called him a stupid loser and childish things like this ( aprox translation),but crazy me I liked it when he called me a bitch and defended himself against me and that made him more attractive to me. I know it's weird,but that's how I felt. I don't think he ever realized I was into him, and many times putting an act, he genuienly thought I was out to get him,but I couldn't tell him I like him straight up. I thought that by acting like this we will form a stronger bond ( wich is crazy,I know). Anyway, Bob comes up behind me , probably witnessing all this and calls him a loser upfront and being hatefull. The guy freezes and Bob says something like \" why you looking at me?\" , he responds that he wasn't looking at him and then Bob throws a punch from behind me and hits his face then leaves. I was startled and didn't had time to react in any way. After that,Michael accuses me that Bob was my bf and we had a verbal fight over it. Long story short, we both went to the principals office and reported on Bob and what happend that day and he was eventually suspended for several weeks. I felt pretty bad for Michael because I thoguht that I was enabling Bob behaviour that day. In the meanwhile he tried to bully me for ratting him out, saying he will take \"revenge\" and that he knows guys who will rape me for a small sum and I should watch myself from now on. He also tried to intimidate Michael on social media,saying his friends will beat him,etc. Michael never told me ,because he didn't saw me as a friend ofc,so I knew from someone else all the details. When he came back in school C. and I confronted him about the texts and he brushed it off,but C. being more aggresive overall than me kept pushing and he slapped her butt saying \"that sound good\" and things like this. Now I was pissed, I told him my folks are already in the process of speaking to the police about his threats (a lie) and he will go to jail and he came close to me and tried to grope me by my boobs saying stuff like \"oh, you want this too\"; \"I don't give a fuck about jail\" etc. People saw that,bcs we were popular/known to many so we had the fortune of people sticking to us and intervened ,and a teacher saw it as well. He was expelled from good from our school after that incident. Unfortunatelly, Michael in his last year started having trouble himself because he went with a bad group who were into selling weed and was asking protection tax from people,was going into fights often and became more like Bob. He had runnings with police couple of times bcs of that,and I have no ideea how he is now. So overall, things were not as black and white as one might think.   \n\nFortunatelly, all the people whom I bullied are fine today with me. Yes, you can say am not a good person or someone you would like to be friends with I guess. I still see C. and forgive her shit, she forgives mine..and we also had small intimacy between us in a \"goth\" period of ours,we liked to larp as being part of the vampire subculture and had crazy experiences in places. Nothing overly sexual though, because I'm mostly into men and all. She cares about me and I care about her very much because we both broken and ducked up people. \n\nLike for me, people with defects and vices look more human than people without. I hate superhero stories and scenarios,fictional or real lfie.. I am more of an anti-hero person, I feel like am neutral evil by nature,but try to protect good people if I have the chance. Metaphorically, I view myself kind of like someone who stands between \"angels\" and \"demons\",but more related to the dark sides of things by nature. ( I am not religious)..so between good characters and really hatefull people. Or you can say It's probably just my mental problems lol , I have ocd ( obsessive compulsive thoughts and ideations )and npd traits ( some narcissistic traits,but not full narc) ,also struggle with anxiety and taken anti depressives in the past,been in therapy etc ..but I just see myself in that metaphorial way.

Someone had posted an individual saying they were scamming and a fraud. They posted a photo of her and her name so I went and looked at her profile. I saw a mutual friend who\u2019s an advocate for autism and victims of trafficking had liked several of her photos. So I send my friend the post and then the link to the IG page these people had made about her. She immediately got back to me and told me the individual they are targeting and harassing is disabled and autistic and she used to live in Florida, where my friend resides and has always volunteered at rescues and would walk dogs and watch them for friends. She loves animals. Her dream is to have a rescue and save dogs. So she decided she wanted to try and live on her own in LA and start a rescue. She\u2019s not doing everything as she should because she doesn\u2019t understand the way she should do things. She\u2019s let people adopt dogs that she\u2019s rescued from backyard breeders before they\u2019re all the way vaccinated because some of these people wanted them immediately. I\u2019m not sure if impulse control or ability to make good choices is part of some levels of autism but I\u2019ve heard people say that\u2019s a part of it. So because she does whatever anyone tells her to do people are literally bullying her and harassing her and following her being confrontational towards her and she honestly doesn\u2019t understand why. I\u2019m in no way saying she should get a pass if she is actually causing more harm to the animals that she wants to save. My issue is rather than contacting mental health services for her or showing her the way she should be running a rescue they immediately go into attack mode and call for people to threaten her and spread the word without letting people know she is both disabled and autistic and even though shes 29 her mentality is that of a young teenager. It\u2019s very apparent in her posts. I just wanted to know if people that know about autism and the ways it can manifest, if they could comment and explain to this rescue and all those bullying her why they are going about this the wrong way. Because the level of stalking, bullying and harassing on social media is sick. \n\nThe rescues name is drdoghousebullycrewrescue \n\nThey made an IG page to run her down as well.

So because she does whatever anyone tells her to do people are literally bullying her and harassing her and following her being confrontational towards her and she honestly doesn\u2019t understand why. I\u2019m in no way saying she should get a pass if she is actually causing more harm to the animals that she wants to save. My issue is rather than contacting mental health services for her or showing her the way she should be running a rescue they immediately go into attack mode and call for people to threaten her and spread the word without letting people know she is both disabled and autistic and even though shes 29 her mentality is that of a young teenager. It\u2019s very apparent in her posts. I just wanted to know if people that know about autism and the ways it can manifest, if they could comment and explain to this rescue and all those bullying her why they are going about this the wrong way. Because the level of stalking, bullying and harassing on social media is sick. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rescues name is drdoghousebullycrewrescue &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They made an IG page to run her down as well.

Anyone who says that you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain is bs (people that tell you to be considerate of your bullies low key wanna see you suffer, but I say why make yourself miserable by a toxic person?).  Don't make excuses for your bad decisions.  Before sharing my bullying story, one of the things I regretted not doing is not gather enough evidence to send my bullies to juvenile jail.  The second thing is taking a leap of faith with/believing a guy that said he liked me randomly not considering that his friends are my bullies' friends, the only reason he went after me is probs because he thinks that I have low self esteem due to the negative reputation that my bullies created about me(he thinks that he can be bad to me because they have treated me sh\\*tty before) My bullies were guys, they are capable of having empathy for other people just not towards me(only towards pretty girls).  Their bullying style is pretty much spreading defamation about a person, talking smack when they start seeing you having friends(it happened so frequently where I just gave up on making friends because there is no point cus they are going to leave anyway), ganged up with other boys from other classes, gullible people questioning you, not having any romantic interest(because the bullies would talk bad about you to them).  My dad always asked me to loosen up a bit in school/make friends, but I was like: How can you loosen up and be yourself when you are constantly judged?/ made to feel like a fugitive at school even when you did nothing wrong?/you feel unsafe or anxious/sensitive to other people's facial expression/body language?/make friends with people who are not accountable for being associated with bullies? That is worse.

I don't really no what to do, so I guess I'll post here and see what you all think.\n\nI (15F) am really passionate about fencing. I started fencing in eighth grade, and have since then just fell in love with the sport. I practice four days a week, and whenever I work out, I always take things seriously and work my absolute best to become the best fencer I can possibly be. I go to a really small fencing gym where everyone knows everyone and there's another fencer (18F) who's been really giving me trouble lately. She's a senior this year and I feel like she'll never give me a break.\n\nAt first, she used to be really nice to me. We weren't best friends or anything, but we'd hang out and talk together in the gym. But, lately, I've started beating her at fencing and she hasn't been so nice. At first, it was just her avoiding conversations with me. I would wave at her, and she didn't wave back. I would talk to her, and she would just give one word answers. But it's gotten worse than that, and I feel like it's not helping that we're in the competitive season. I keep scoring better than her, often beating her friends and teammates, which I know bugs her, but it's a part of the sport. Whenever we're at practice, she never fences me anymore. We do fencing bouts in a rotation, and whenever she rotates to fence me, she always comes up with a story about why her weapon is broken or why her shoes are too dirty or why she hurt herself or any excuse she can think of not to fence me. When I talk to her, she doesn't even give me one word answers, she just looks away and acts like she didn't hear anything. Lately, she has gotten in rotation to fence me, and just flat-out said \"I don't want to fence anymore.\" and left. The other day, I heard her saying really mean backhanded comments about me. She wasn't saying them straight to my face, but she knew I was in the room, and purposely said my name loud and clear so I would hear it. When I asked her what was that supposed to mean, she just turned her head away from me and pretended she couldn't hear me. I asked again, but she just kept pretending I was invisible.\n\nAnd, what sucks is that I know she's doing it just to make me feel less-than, but the truth is that it's working. I feel so powerless whenever I'm with her. I'm just... invisible. My coach has told me about her before. Our gym only has one coach who has full authority over everything. I think he might've noticed what's been going on between us, but one day he just told me, \"I know she can be tough sometimes, but she's just such a fun girl. I know I could kick her out, but I think we'd all just miss her too much...\" I wouldn't. \n\nIs there anything I can possibly do to make the situation any better? If I confronted her, she'd just act like she didn't hear me, and it seems like the only adult in the situation doesn't care that she's bullying me. Do I jut wait until she graduates?

I was bullied basically from 2nd grade to the end of high school. For the most part of my grade school education I was a loner, no friends, and even the people I considered friends weren't real...I still remember the times I would trust them, and it would backfire: they would talk behind my back, throw me under the bus for something I didn't do with the teacher/bullies, and largely ignore me and treat me as an outsider...but at least I had some friends, right? These guys weren't my bullies. My bullies were the guys that took me to the bathroom and hit me, or push me up against a locker in the hall, or take my backpack and dump it empty on the ground, or put pencil shavings in my hair or spread nasty rumours about me. I didn't have the courage to say anything back to them. This was my grade school life. I don't know if the teachers knew, if they did then they just ignored it. I've had a few great teachers along the way some of which have been an inspiration to me, but they are far and few between, vast majority of them (all of them prior to high school) just ignored what everyone else knew.\n\nMy life at home wasn't better either. Alcoholic father, parents always fighting, separated, divorced, got back together. Was a total mess. Don't get me wrong, I know my mother tried her best, and I respect and appreciate what she has been through because I know that the decisions she made she made with my best interest at heart, but man, did my life fucking suck at school and outside of it. The only place I felt safe was playing video games or going on a long bike ride. I had found \"friends\" online, they were my escape for a large part. It helped, but it never really shook the the hell I always had to return to when I \"Unplugged\". Especially because playing video games was a sure fire way of getting in trouble for not studying, but they didn't get it...no one gets it, right?\n\nBut listen here.\n\nIT GETS BETTER. You'll make friends you never thought you'd have. Life will be a blessing, and you will appreciate it more than most. You will be strong, you will be courageous, and you will have the metal to be a leader like no other. You understand suffering, you've experienced it and lived it. You have an intimate relationship with depression and anxiety and suicidal ideations. You know what loneliness feels like. No heroes journey is ever easy, it always starts with a struggle that is designed to strengthen you. This is your journey. This is the start of YOUR adventure.\n\nI was always a little socially weird, perhaps a touch of aspergers as someone recently pointed out (I'm in my late 20s now btw). I'm soon to graduate medical school. I'm on track to be a surgeon. Since graduating high school my life has turned to an incredible adventure. I still don't have a lot of friends, I'm still a little weird at times, but the friends I do have are the best friends I could've ever asked for. They would stick by me thick and thin, many of them even point out if I'm being odd and help me correct it, not in a malicious way, but in a loving way.\n\nI wasn't the gifted kid in the class. All through elementary and middle school I was at the bottom of my class, by A LOT. I failed a class in the 7th grade. In high school I started doing a little better but still almost failed a class in the 9th grade (pity pass...right on the dot), well enough to get into University, but nothing great. Afterwards though? When the bullies \"went away\" because your surrounded by like minded people who are aiming high and for the stars? I came out on top. Top of my class by a huge margin. 95th percentile nationally on the medical board exams. When others were stressed and being beaten down by the program I was able to stand up and support them and be the leader that can help them through it. Why? Because of my bullies. I was thick skinned, nothing bothered me at this point in my life. Snarky remarks? Had to work hard? Malicious professors? Tough residents? Tough attending physicians? DOESN'T MATTER because I laughed it off. They're nothing compared to my bullies that scared the living daylight out of me.\n\nI don't hate my bullies. Fuck them, but I surely don't hate them. They made me who I am, one thick skinned son of a bitch who can lead his fellow classmates and residents. Who can think clearly under pressure (I hope...otherwise surgical residency'll be a rude awakening), can advocate for his patients, and can empathize with the suffering of his patients. So at the end of it? I thank my bullies. Sure, you made a few years of my life tough, but man did you make me tough.\n\nAnd when YOU are the tough one. Be different. Even with people you don't like, be different. Be the change. Be the leader. Be the voice that calms. When you've been through such a shit experience you have the opportunity to be better. Take it. You will find incredible satisfaction in helping others, but it means letting go. It means forgiving the people that made your life hell, because they helped you discover meaning in yours. Be different.\n\nKeep grinding. It gets better. LIFE gets better, high school aren't your \"best\" years, they are for some, but that's only FOUR years, you have your whole life ahead of you. Ignore all of the haters and just keep GOING, because there is light at the end of the tunnel, but you gotta claw your ass to the light.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSomeone who has been where you are\n\nP.S If it's getting bad and you're in genuine danger, be sure to tell someone for your own safety.

All through elementary and middle school I was at the bottom of my class, by A LOT. I failed a class in the 7th grade. In high school I started doing a little better but still almost failed a class in the 9th grade (pity pass...right on the dot), well enough to get into University, but nothing great. Afterwards though? When the bullies &amp;quot;went away&amp;quot; because your surrounded by like minded people who are aiming high and for the stars? I came out on top. Top of my class by a huge margin. 95th percentile nationally on the medical board exams. When others were stressed and being beaten down by the program I was able to stand up and support them and be the leader that can help them through it. Why? Because of my bullies. I was thick skinned, nothing bothered me at this point in my life. Snarky remarks? Had to work hard? Malicious professors? Tough residents? Tough attending physicians? DOESN&amp;#39;T MATTER because I laughed it off. They&amp;#39;re nothing compared to my bullies that scared the living daylight out of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t hate my bullies. Fuck them, but I surely don&amp;#39;t hate them. They made me who I am, one thick skinned son of a bitch who can lead his fellow classmates and residents. Who can think clearly under pressure (I hope...otherwise surgical residency&amp;#39;ll be a rude awakening), can advocate for his patients, and can empathize with the suffering of his patients. So at the end of it? I thank my bullies. Sure, you made a few years of my life tough, but man did you make me tough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when YOU are the tough one. Be different. Even with people you don&amp;#39;t like, be different. Be the change. Be the leader. Be the voice that calms. When you&amp;#39;ve been through such a shit experience you have the opportunity to be better. Take it. You will find incredible satisfaction in helping others, but it means letting go. It means forgiving the people that made your life hell, because they helped you discover meaning in yours. Be different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep grinding. It gets better. LIFE gets better, high school aren&amp;#39;t your &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; years, they are for some, but that&amp;#39;s only FOUR years, you have your whole life ahead of you. Ignore all of the haters and just keep GOING, because there is light at the end of the tunnel, but you gotta claw your ass to the light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone who has been where you are&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S If it&amp;#39;s getting bad and you&amp;#39;re in genuine danger, be sure to tell someone for your own safety. This message is meant to be hopeful, not a &amp;quot;keep your head low and just ignore it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sw9l", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "sdzp4x", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MDthenLife", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 12, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/bullying/comments/sdzp4x/if_youre_getting_bullied_dont_worry_itll_pass/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/sdzp4x/if_youre_getting_bullied_dont_worry_itll_pass/", "subreddit_subscribers": 7766, "created_utc": 1643293864.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "bullying", "selftext": "", "author_fullname": "t2_dbrj821b", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "advice please so every job I seem to go in I have issues with someone being horrible for no reason at all?

Tom was kind of the class clown, and I found out he had a \u201ccrush\u201d on me. He told me and then because he moved, we swore to keep it a promise. Then he told Lily, who told her friends and it got out all over the place. I didn\u2019t really care though, but then my best friend told me she was playing video games with them and he said \u201chah, I can\u2019t believe she thought I actually liked her.\u201d When he thought he was muted. Before this, I had a little incident where my anxiety was really high and three people were pointing sharp things at me, and I have a very bad phobia for this. Not even close to me though, just pointed at me. I got really scared, and this was before I knew about my anxiety and depression, so I couldn\u2019t control my feelings. I also was learning Kung fu just then, so I had an instinct and kicked one of the boys in the stomach. I felt really bad about it and I heard yet again, that Tom and Lily were on a FaceTime and made up a really cruel nickname. I don\u2019t know what it was, but I don\u2019t want to know.

Tom was kind of the class clown, and I found out he had a \u201ccrush\u201d on me. He told me and then because he moved, we swore to keep it a promise. Then he told Lily, who told her friends and it got out all over the place. I didn\u2019t really care though, but then my best friend told me she was playing video games with them and he said \u201chah, I can\u2019t believe she thought I actually liked her.\u201d When he thought he was muted. Before this, I had a little incident where my anxiety was really high and three people were pointing sharp things at me, and I have a very bad phobia for this. Not even close to me though, just pointed at me. I got really scared, and this was before I knew about my anxiety and depression, so I couldn\u2019t control my feelings. I also was learning Kung fu just then, so I had an instinct and kicked one of the boys in the stomach. I felt really bad about it and I heard yet again, that Tom and Lily were on a FaceTime and made up a really cruel nickname. I don\u2019t know what it was, but I don\u2019t want to know.

I also suggest Faith G Harper's Unf\\*ck your Boundaries (you can find it on Amazon). She also has a website I believe. Check out Bren\u00e9 Brown's website as well and her podcast called Unlocking Us. She has a great book about her research on the science and psychology behind shame. But anyway,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**HERE IS MY COMMENT:**\n\n  \n*Oh boy are you in luck that I read this post! I can help. You are really lucky I saw this. This is not common knowledge. Literally at all. you are actually astute for thinking to ask it. I too am learning myself and educating myself on this at the moment so I'm glad we found each other.*\n\n*No one- literally no one will give you a decent answer to a question like this on a sub reddit. It's too complicated and would take hours to even research to even have one.*\n\n*But there is a way to answer this... and I will give you links.*\n\n***tl;dr:***\n\n***Paul Ekman is a researcher who studies the face and human body language. He's been learning it his whole life and he's (legitimately and literally) the world's leading expert on it. His work is right down your alley. I will give you information on how to find his work. His research will keep you emotionally safe too, not just teach you to spot danger.***\n\n*40 + years of government funded research, several cross referenced research studies, and several collaborations later, we now have a scientific understanding of it.*\n\n*He has several books, a real program online to learn how to read people, and a really awesome show called Lie to Me (super entertaining) based off of his work. He is also responsible for why Pixar, Disney and Dreamworks have realistic animated emotions and expressions. The real FBI actually uses his research to train secret service workers.*\n\n*Watch lie to me on Hulu if you're not into reading and need a little motivation. Check the site out. If you decide you don't want to read the books, they do have some workshops you can try online. There is even a program you can use online to learn (but I think there is a fee). I'm reading his books right now and it isn't a gimmick. I think he just wanted to profit from some of his research. I do believe on the site it does say that they use a very similar program to train government field agents so you're learning the real thing.*\n\n*You can look up a biography if you want reassurance of his work. But anyway, the links!*\n\n*If you want to learn just how to read people, read* [*Unmasking the Face by Paul Ekman*](https://www.amazon.com/Unmasking-Face-Recognizing-Emotions-Expressions/dp/1883536367/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1HFDMEVEA3JQU&amp;keywords=unmasking+the+face+paul+ekman&amp;qid=1670504294&amp;sprefix=unmasking+the+face%2Caps%2C199&amp;sr=8-1) *. The whole book is geared towards teaching just that to you. It's only 200 pages and it looks like it's pretty quick to get through. There's a lot of pictures to help you identify facial expressions in it and it explains the same things the program does on the site.*\n\n*If you fall in love with his work like I did (I'm still not done reading his books yet), especially if you watch the show, then here are two more titles that might help with everyday life:*\n\n[*Emotions Revealed*](https://www.amazon.com/Emotions-Revealed-Second-Recognizing-Communication/dp/0805083391/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3DVLEAM2L8F5Z&amp;keywords=telling+lies+paul+ekman&amp;qid=1670504506&amp;sprefix=telling+lies+paul+e%2Caps%2C126&amp;sr=8-5)\n\n*This one will teach you all about human emotion, how to handle them, how to manage them, why they happen, etc. It also delves into his research on how he discovered what he did about it. Super rich and thick with information and facts.*\n\n[*Telling Lies*](https://www.amazon.com/Telling-Lies-Marketplace-Politics-Marriage/dp/0393337456/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1HJUBM6J1AQLV&amp;keywords=telling+lies+paul+ekman+book&amp;qid=1670505088&amp;sprefix=telling+lies+paul+ekman%2Caps%2C121&amp;sr=8-1)\n\n*This one I have not read, but it's all the same topic. This one is a little broader than knowledge for personal use. It deals with sociology.*\n\n*And here is his website:*\n\n[Paul Ekman Group (Website)](https://www.paulekman.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsovP0Yfq-wIVsxetBh0BlgumEAAYASAAEgLHNvD_BwE)", "author_fullname": "t2_az4udr4b", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Offering info: how to spot a bully and read danger", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bullying", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_zfyzx1", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1670506260.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.bullying", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I was on a self defense subreddit and someone asked the sub how they could figure out how to spot danger and avoid being attacked and learn how to read people.

I can help. You are really lucky I saw this. This is not common knowledge. Literally at all. you are actually astute for thinking to ask it. I too am learning myself and educating myself on this at the moment so I&amp;#39;m glad we found each other.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No one- literally no one will give you a decent answer to a question like this on a sub reddit. It&amp;#39;s too complicated and would take hours to even research to even have one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But there is a way to answer this... and I will give you links.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;tl;dr:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paul Ekman is a researcher who studies the face and human body language. He&amp;#39;s been learning it his whole life and he&amp;#39;s (legitimately and literally) the world&amp;#39;s leading expert on it. His work is right down your alley. I will give you information on how to find his work. His research will keep you emotionally safe too, not just teach you to spot danger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;40 + years of government funded research, several cross referenced research studies, and several collaborations later, we now have a scientific understanding of it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He has several books, a real program online to learn how to read people, and a really awesome show called Lie to Me (super entertaining) based off of his work. He is also responsible for why Pixar, Disney and Dreamworks have realistic animated emotions and expressions. The real FBI actually uses his research to train secret service workers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch lie to me on Hulu if you&amp;#39;re not into reading and need a little motivation. Check the site out. If you decide you don&amp;#39;t want to read the books, they do have some workshops you can try online. There is even a program you can use online to learn (but I think there is a fee). I&amp;#39;m reading his books right now and it isn&amp;#39;t a gimmick. I think he just wanted to profit from some of his research. I do believe on the site it does say that they use a very similar program to train government field agents so you&amp;#39;re learning the real thing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can look up a biography if you want reassurance of his work. But anyway, the links!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to learn just how to read people, read&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Unmasking-Face-Recognizing-Emotions-Expressions/dp/1883536367/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1HFDMEVEA3JQU&amp;amp;keywords=unmasking+the+face+paul+ekman&amp;amp;qid=1670504294&amp;amp;sprefix=unmasking+the+face%2Caps%2C199&amp;amp;sr=8-1\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unmasking the Face by Paul Ekman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;. The whole book is geared towards teaching just that to you. It&amp;#39;s only 200 pages and it looks like it&amp;#39;s pretty quick to get through. There&amp;#39;s a lot of pictures to help you identify facial expressions in it and it explains the same things the program does on the site.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you fall in love with his work like I did (I&amp;#39;m still not done reading his books yet), especially if you watch the show, then here are two more titles that might help with everyday life:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Emotions-Revealed-Second-Recognizing-Communication/dp/0805083391/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3DVLEAM2L8F5Z&amp;amp;keywords=telling+lies+paul+ekman&amp;amp;qid=1670504506&amp;amp;sprefix=telling+lies+paul+e%2Caps%2C126&amp;amp;sr=8-5\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emotions Revealed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This one will teach you all about human emotion, how to handle them, how to manage them, why they happen, etc. It also delves into his research on how he discovered what he did about it. Super rich and thick with information and facts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Telling-Lies-Marketplace-Politics-Marriage/dp/0393337456/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1HJUBM6J1AQLV&amp;amp;keywords=telling+lies+paul+ekman+book&amp;amp;qid=1670505088&amp;amp;sprefix=telling+lies+paul+ekman%2Caps%2C121&amp;amp;sr=8-1\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Telling Lies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This one I have not read, but it&amp;#39;s all the same topic. This one is a little broader than knowledge for personal use. It deals with sociology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And here is his website:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.paulekman.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsovP0Yfq-wIVsxetBh0BlgumEAAYASAAEgLHNvD_BwE\"&gt;Paul Ekman Group (Website)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sw9l", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "zfyzx1", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pernicuslex", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/bullying/comments/zfyzx1/offering_info_how_to_spot_a_bully_and_read_danger/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/zfyzx1/offering_info_how_to_spot_a_bully_and_read_danger/", "subreddit_subscribers": 7766, "created_utc": 1670506260.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "bullying", "selftext": "[small SH TW] This is more a post about the people In charge and very little about the actual details of my torment. Nonetheless I hope my story helps someone feel seen.  \nI loathe the vice principal of my elementary school to the point that I genuinely wish horrible things upon her. I know I shouldn\u2019t hold this kind of grudge especially this far into my adulthood, but I can\u2019t not. She was responsible for a lot of my early life suffering. I experienced nearly nonstop torment from my peers and she sat, and did nothing. I would come to her office to report the harassment and plead for it to stop nearly weekly if not daily, no punishments were ever implemented. Not even a talking to to the ones who made me so miserable. Only once did any punishment take place which was a short conversation between her and my main tormentor, which I later faced hell for. even so I tried, and tried for it to stop. When nothing was happening I attempted reaching out to the principal which she intentionally, and frequently barred me from doing.\n\n At this point, I was not only being bullied by my peers, but by multiple members of the school staff as well, including my only confidant; my counselor. she went from kind, reassuring and understanding of my problems too cold, rude and frustrated the minute I walked into her room. She even went as far to invite my tormentor, knowing the full extent of the harassment, along to the sessions that were meant to be one on one with her (there was no attempt to try to make us understand to reconcile. My bully just sat in the back and said nothing, simply an intimidating presence to a private conversation). \n\nMy teachers were no better: isolating me from the class, frequent public humiliation sessions and punishments for things I never did. I wish I was exaggerating or viewing normal teacher behavior from a hurting child\u2019s lens. Unfortunately, I was not. my parents remember and talk about it at times not knowing the full context of how bad things really were. I look back now I\u2019m shock at how any adult could treat a child the way they had treated me. This went from the first grade, all the way up until high school, because the one person who could change it refused to. I was small, quiet and out of the way, I was respectful and followed the rules. There was no reason for any of this. naturally, from all the betrayal, I faced from the people who are meant to be \u201ctrusted adults\u201d I never told my parents. I just sat and dealt with it, completely isolated. I couldn\u2019t cope.  I began to self harm in the third grade by grinding ing my fists raw while sitting alone on the balcktop. In the fifth grade, it escalated to pulling chunks of skin out of my arms with my nails. I don\u2019t even understand what I was doing until the eighth grade when I had access to the Internet and found out about cutting. That became my new method which is one I still cannot kick. \n\nAll this torment and betrayal still greatly affects my daily life. Nearly daily, I sit, stressing the point of shutting down about what I\u2019m going to wear thinking I\u2019m a child again who\u2019s going to be harassed by groups of boys and girls alike for wearing hand me downs in worn out shoes. I can\u2019t stand women, I\u2019m scared of them. I can\u2019t let my guard down for fear of being ripped apart the second I speak a word. I\u2019ve never had any female friends because of this and I frequently find myself angry crying at the \u201cmy BFF\u201d posts on social media. So often feel worthless and like the people around me don\u2019t really care. That they will leave me just like all the kids that kept me around to laugh at me behind my back.

now and then, I see increasingly more toxicity from the African American community. As an African American myself, I find it weird because most of us expect other races to be toxic to us. I see kids of other races, most notably whites, constantly getting ridiculed, shamed, and bullied for being of their race, while they can\u2019t stand up for themselves because every time  they do, someone pulls the racism card and the victim is labeled as racist and further bullied. I feel like my race\u2019s demand for respect and all that other stuff has slowly manifested itself into something toxic. From slaves escaping to bring better lives to their people, to people of the same race shaming other races for attention and popularity, and using their own race as a scapegoat when things get tight. I\u2019ve also witnessed kids get bullied and shamed for their race at my own school, which was small, so imagine how much the number of kids experiencing this increases in larger schools. This type of toxic behavior is fueled by one main thing, and that\u2019s the idea that blacks can\u2019t be racist.

As an African American myself, I find it weird because most of us expect other races to be toxic to us. I see kids of other races, most notably whites, constantly getting ridiculed, shamed, and bullied for being of their race, while they can\u2019t stand up for themselves because every time  they do, someone pulls the racism card and the victim is labeled as racist and further bullied. I feel like my race\u2019s demand for respect and all that other stuff has slowly manifested itself into something toxic. From slaves escaping to bring better lives to their people, to people of the same race shaming other races for attention and popularity, and using their own race as a scapegoat when things get tight. I\u2019ve also witnessed kids get bullied and shamed for their race at my own school, which was small, so imagine how much the number of kids experiencing this increases in larger schools. This type of toxic behavior is fueled by one main thing, and that\u2019s the idea that blacks can\u2019t be racist.

If you are suffering and need any kind of relief, hopefully this helps:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSelf perspective from a bully's insight is going to be shitty, because they're shallow people and don't know how to process their own self loathing and abusive behavior. That's why they are the way they are in the first place. Their EQ is low...very very low.You are on here and you are asking for help so you are light years ahead of the cave men bothering you, and obviously more mature to be able to admit it and ask for help. They never will and most of them will end up in jail over a DUI, Domestic violence dispute or drugs, or just plain dead in my case. So kudos to you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**FIRST OF ALL**\n\nNo one that puts you down in any way shape or form is your friend. Or anyone that agrees with a bully's perspective and sides with him. I am actually dealing with the same thing right now at age 30, and two of them I was in love with and it HURTS so fucking bad to watch them walk away with my rapist around their arms, so I get it. Believe me I do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBullies don't disappear as an adult, but being wiser about how you handle it *can* make them vanish (to an extent).\n\n**You might want to visit your boundaries**\n\nSee if there are some weak spots. I don't know if you read or not, but I do have a book in mind that would help. If you do, let me know and I'll shoot you the title. The author is pretty amazing. They have quite a few good self help books published.\n\nIf you don't, hopefully this section taken from it will help:\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**The Grey Rock Method***Another trick for dealing with boundary busting individuals, or just toxic shitty situations in which someone is being harmful, is the grey rock method.A blogger who goes by Skylar on the 180rule.com developed what she called \"the grey rock method\" as a tool for convincing abusive individuals to leave YOU, by making yourself as boring and non responsive as possible. You essentially become a grey rock.****The pane of Glass Trick****Are you stuck with motherfuckers who push your every last button? One of the tricks I have found that really helped me is to imagine a pane of glass between me and them. I can hear and see them, but their emotional bullshit stops at the glass.*\n\n*\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_*\n\nOkay the quote is over. Me again.\n\nWhat I am saying is, the only reason they can bully you is because:\n\n**You are there for them to bully. No one said you have to react, be their friend or even stand there when they do it (or answer them when they text you). Just walk out of the room if they make a comment.**\n\n*No response is always going to be the best response, because there is no ammunition.It's the law of inertia. You can't move something forward that was never set in motion.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Basically, you don't have to answer. If you like who you are, then you don't need tooverexplain anything to anyone else. And if you don't, then Deefffinitely do not answereither. It will leave a void of self hatred to constantly feel the need to justify yourexistence. Just short \"no\" answers are fine. No reason why needed, even if they makeyou feel that way. It might take some practice to stop the word vomit gut reactions you(might be) having to their provoking.... Which leads me tothis...*\n\n**They're provoking you because they need you to care. Which means they need YOU to validate THEM, even though they will never admit it. So they need you wayyy more than you do. That's probably why you are getting bullied.**\n\n*I had a best friend that was angry I used to be perfect at everything. She felt inferioraround me a lot, and even admitted it. She was constantly undermining my expertise inthings, how I am as a person, the way I self identified, etc. He friends have been bullyingme almost three years, and now all of their accusations are right. They weren't though,and that's the point. That's WHY they need you so much to care that they don't like you.Don't get caught up in getting them to like you, its a trap. Don't let it get to the pointwhere I am at. It's not worth it.*\n\n*They want to know that they hurt you because its the laziest, easiest fix to getting liked byother people that doesn't involve any work. Shit talkers are toxic people. People who puteffort into being good and care about it will be better friends.*\n\n**SECOND OF ALL**\n\nSchool protection is great and a wonderful idea... if life were ideal. I'm not opposed to telling your principal what is going on, but some adults are terrible people. I'll be honest. Some principals might make you feel w*orse,* and might even side with your bullies. AS much as I agree with the other comments, just be cautious. Because the authority figure might make you feel worse than the bullies and brush it off. Which is why so many kids are scared to even ask. *Gaslighting* (research the word it will save your whole life) does happen to students, as unfortunate as that is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbut you might get lucky and be able to get real help from faculty. Just don't be down on yourself like you are making a big deal out of nothing if they dismiss it. Your feelings are going to hurt your everyday life, whether you ignore them or think that they are silly, so clearly they are not. They have an impact on you whether or not you want them to. If they have a mind of their own like that and are running the show, then I can say from self experience, you might be a little detached from yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**LASTLY**\n\n\"Damn, that C+ I got in chem because I was upset the other day sucks! I should just get over it already!\" ... That's not remotely realistic or how feelings work. AT. ALL.\n\nThat's why you got the 75 in the first place. You can not just \"get over it\". You need to *work through it,* and you don't know how and that's why it keeps coming back. It needs to be resolved, you can't just \"get over it.\" To be honest, talking about it doesn't always resolve it either. Working through it is a little trickier than that. That's why you don't always feel better after talking to someone else. It's something internal that isn't clicking. That's why these people's words are still bothering you. You need to understand yourself and outside love and advice can only resolve so much.\n\nOdds are at your age you're going to get a mix of reactions and it's going to confuse you:\n\n* People who care but don't know how to manage their own emotions enough to give you solid advice\n* people who nurture your pain but don't get the concrete stuff\n* people who just want to listen and wish you weren't hurting\n\nAND THEN THERE'S THE \"get over it\" BULLIES.\n\nI hope this helped. Good Luck! Remember you are in charge of your life. You might not be able to control other people's actions, but bullies are just tricking you into thinking that you need to get them to stop in the first place.\n\nYou can stop it without them. That's the beauty of boundaries. It's all about you and what you can do for yourself.", "author_fullname": "t2_az4udr4b", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Suffering from bullying?

They have quite a few good self help books published.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t, hopefully this section taken from it will help:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Grey Rock Method&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another trick for dealing with boundary busting individuals, or just toxic shitty situations in which someone is being harmful, is the grey rock method.A blogger who goes by Skylar on the 180rule.com developed what she called &amp;quot;the grey rock method&amp;quot; as a tool for convincing abusive individuals to leave YOU, by making yourself as boring and non responsive as possible. You essentially become a grey rock.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pane of Glass Trick&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you stuck with motherfuckers who push your every last button? One of the tricks I have found that really helped me is to imagine a pane of glass between me and them. I can hear and see them, but their emotional bullshit stops at the glass.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay the quote is over. Me again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I am saying is, the only reason they can bully you is because:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are there for them to bully. No one said you have to react, be their friend or even stand there when they do it (or answer them when they text you). Just walk out of the room if they make a comment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No response is always going to be the best response, because there is no ammunition.It&amp;#39;s the law of inertia. You can&amp;#39;t move something forward that was never set in motion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Basically, you don&amp;#39;t have to answer. If you like who you are, then you don&amp;#39;t need tooverexplain anything to anyone else. And if you don&amp;#39;t, then Deefffinitely do not answereither. It will leave a void of self hatred to constantly feel the need to justify yourexistence. Just short &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; answers are fine. No reason why needed, even if they makeyou feel that way. It might take some practice to stop the word vomit gut reactions you(might be) having to their provoking.... Which leads me tothis...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They&amp;#39;re provoking you because they need you to care. Which means they need YOU to validate THEM, even though they will never admit it. So they need you wayyy more than you do. That&amp;#39;s probably why you are getting bullied.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I had a best friend that was angry I used to be perfect at everything. She felt inferioraround me a lot, and even admitted it. She was constantly undermining my expertise inthings, how I am as a person, the way I self identified, etc. He friends have been bullyingme almost three years, and now all of their accusations are right. They weren&amp;#39;t though,and that&amp;#39;s the point. That&amp;#39;s WHY they need you so much to care that they don&amp;#39;t like you.Don&amp;#39;t get caught up in getting them to like you, its a trap. Don&amp;#39;t let it get to the pointwhere I am at. It&amp;#39;s not worth it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They want to know that they hurt you because its the laziest, easiest fix to getting liked byother people that doesn&amp;#39;t involve any work. Shit talkers are toxic people. People who puteffort into being good and care about it will be better friends.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SECOND OF ALL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;School protection is great and a wonderful idea... if life were ideal. I&amp;#39;m not opposed to telling your principal what is going on, but some adults are terrible people. I&amp;#39;ll be honest. Some principals might make you feel w&lt;em&gt;orse,&lt;/em&gt; and might even side with your bullies. AS much as I agree with the other comments, just be cautious. Because the authority figure might make you feel worse than the bullies and brush it off. Which is why so many kids are scared to even ask. &lt;em&gt;Gaslighting&lt;/em&gt; (research the word it will save your whole life) does happen to students, as unfortunate as that is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;but you might get lucky and be able to get real help from faculty. Just don&amp;#39;t be down on yourself like you are making a big deal out of nothing if they dismiss it. Your feelings are going to hurt your everyday life, whether you ignore them or think that they are silly, so clearly they are not. They have an impact on you whether or not you want them to. If they have a mind of their own like that and are running the show, then I can say from self experience, you might be a little detached from yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LASTLY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Damn, that C+ I got in chem because I was upset the other day sucks! I should just get over it already!&amp;quot; ... That&amp;#39;s not remotely realistic or how feelings work. AT. ALL.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why you got the 75 in the first place. You can not just &amp;quot;get over it&amp;quot;. You need to &lt;em&gt;work through it,&lt;/em&gt; and you don&amp;#39;t know how and that&amp;#39;s why it keeps coming back. It needs to be resolved, you can&amp;#39;t just &amp;quot;get over it.&amp;quot; To be honest, talking about it doesn&amp;#39;t always resolve it either. Working through it is a little trickier than that. That&amp;#39;s why you don&amp;#39;t always feel better after talking to someone else. It&amp;#39;s something internal that isn&amp;#39;t clicking. That&amp;#39;s why these people&amp;#39;s words are still bothering you. You need to understand yourself and outside love and advice can only resolve so much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Odds are at your age you&amp;#39;re going to get a mix of reactions and it&amp;#39;s going to confuse you:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;People who care but don&amp;#39;t know how to manage their own emotions enough to give you solid advice&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;people who nurture your pain but don&amp;#39;t get the concrete stuff&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;people who just want to listen and wish you weren&amp;#39;t hurting&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AND THEN THERE&amp;#39;S THE &amp;quot;get over it&amp;quot; BULLIES.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this helped. Good Luck! Remember you are in charge of your life. You might not be able to control other people&amp;#39;s actions, but bullies are just tricking you into thinking that you need to get them to stop in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can stop it without them. That&amp;#39;s the beauty of boundaries. It&amp;#39;s all about you and what you can do for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null,
