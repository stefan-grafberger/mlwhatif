I REALLY WANT TO CHANGE&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a few weeks i have an exam and I am now sure that i will also fail in that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "call_to_action": "", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sw9l", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "xbb1zz", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ronakraj12345", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/bullying/comments/xbb1zz/its_getting_too_much_now/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/xbb1zz/its_getting_too_much_now/", "subreddit_subscribers": 7766, "created_utc": 1662877177.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "bullying", "selftext": "A ex friend reached out on Instagram last night thinking I forgot about her and hoping I\u2019m doing well.

I am doing well and I do remember you. I\u2019m also aware you reached out back in 2018.

If things didn\u2019t go your way, you\u2019d get so sensitive and take your frustration out on other people. You\u2019d constantly say \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d but nothing changed, and I remember having to deal with that numerous times to the point where I didn\u2019t even want to attend school because of the amount of times I was being bullied by you. I hope you know what I\u2019m talking about because I can recall every single memory of where I felt like I was treated like shit and no matter how many times I\u2019d ask you to stop doing something, you never listened or even cared about how it was affecting me. \n\nYou were once a really good friend and I cherished a lot of the memories we had.

This is literally how you acted in middle school and I don\u2019t want to put in any effort dealing with that. \n\nThis message is years worth of what I had to deal with back at school that makes it difficult for me to want to reconcile a friendship with you.

The fact that he can't always have clean clothes (his washing machine is broken, and he doesn't know when his parents will be able to afford one), and that he can't afford some basic supplies doesn't help.

She\u2019s telling them I\u2019m a \u201cpsychopath\u201d (which baffles me, because I\u2019ve managed my temper every single interaction with this woman) I called her a bully (the mom) and I said her daughter was cruel.

It always irritated me.\n\nBut the thing is Im aware that the shows sort of reflect how real life schools/adults handle it, especially in current times.\n\nSo I want to ask experts, How accurate was the portrayal of 13 Reasons Why's high school compared to the current school system?", "author_fullname": "t2_zc6u22", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "High School Bullying: TV vs Real Life", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bullying", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_x5lovq", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1662294134.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.bullying", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello!

Sometimes I would have friends and their friends wouldn\u2019t like me or want to exclude me even if I was really nice to them and a fun good time. I\u2019m in my mid-20s now and this still happens to me. Where the friends of friends are nice to my face but are silently bulling me or excluding me from things. I think I\u2019m a pretty moderately pretty person as I\u2019m told and I don\u2019t normally like to bring up looks. But ever since I was little my family has always told me that sometimes people will treat me a certain way because I\u2019m pretty and because I\u2019m kind and they either feel jealous (which I hate the word because it\u2019s so awkward to use) or intimidated by me. Lately I\u2019ve been putting myself out there because I want to grow my friendship Circle as I am a young mom and I\u2019m going through a new cycle of people by my side as I\u2019m sure y\u2019all know that it becomes a new chapter in life. My sister-in-law is getting married to my brother soon and I have been meeting her friends. It\u2019s so awkward because I try to be so kind and fun because she\u2019s my family and I love her but they never talk to me, never are kind of me and honestly most of the time pretend like I\u2019m not there. Recently I went on a trip for my friends birthday and her two friends were silently excluding me the whole time. It came to points where I felt disappointed in my friend because I know she saw how they were treating me and did nothing. I don\u2019t know if these are just very territorial people with a \u2018no new friends vibe\u2019 or what. I am tired of the way I am being treated but I do not want any arguments or fights.

Sometimes I would have friends and their friends wouldn\u2019t like me or want to exclude me even if I was really nice to them and a fun good time. I\u2019m in my mid-20s now and this still happens to me. Where the friends of friends are nice to my face but are silently bulling me or excluding me from things. I think I\u2019m a pretty moderately pretty person as I\u2019m told and I don\u2019t normally like to bring up looks. But ever since I was little my family has always told me that sometimes people will treat me a certain way because I\u2019m pretty and because I\u2019m kind and they either feel jealous (which I hate the word because it\u2019s so awkward to use) or intimidated by me. Lately I\u2019ve been putting myself out there because I want to grow my friendship Circle as I am a young mom and I\u2019m going through a new cycle of people by my side as I\u2019m sure y\u2019all know that it becomes a new chapter in life. My sister-in-law is getting married to my brother soon and I have been meeting her friends. It\u2019s so awkward because I try to be so kind and fun because she\u2019s my family and I love her but they never talk to me, never are kind of me and honestly most of the time pretend like I\u2019m not there. Recently I went on a trip for my friends birthday and her two friends were silently excluding me the whole time. It came to points where I felt disappointed in my friend because I know she saw how they were treating me and did nothing. I don\u2019t know if these are just very territorial people with a \u2018no new friends vibe\u2019 or what. I am tired of the way I am being treated but I do not want any arguments or fights.

I was bullied by girls some 4 or 5 times between the ages of 11 and 18.\n\n-Age 11, a group of older girls bullied me on the bus every day, essentially because I was weird and awkward. Typical middle school crap: they'd rag on my clothes, my awkward mannerisms, my taste in music (anime soundtracks lol). The tried to trip me every time I got off the bus. \n\n-Age 12, a girl who was my friend the year before started picking on me in front of other girls. One time she kicked me in the butt when I was walking up the stairs in front of her. \n\n-Age 12, a girl in my class was shitty to me because I had a huge crush on a guy who was a condescending douchebag to her. She and I knew each other through the guy, I didn't know they had bad blood. I didn't understand what the problem was at the time. She'd randomly say mean things to me, and one time she hid my binder and school books while I was changing in gym class. Frankly, she got over it the next year, and was actually super cool with me. I guess we all do dumb shit at 12.\n\n-Age 13, a girl who had been my friend the previous year (again!) started bullying me. One time she smeared a packet of ketchup in my hair for no reason, and then tried to beat me up in between classes. It took me too long to realize that that same guy(!) had also been a jerk to her. So basically, I was too naive and besotted to realize he was a jerk. \n\nAge 13, My friend got angry with me for having a different religion than she did, and suddenly a rumor cropped up that I was a witchy lesbian (which, a) is hilarious to me now, and b) is at least 25% true). Our group of mutual friends stopped speaking to me.\n\nAge 18: The same girl who got angry about religion slut-shamed me for having sex, and our group ostracized me.\n\nFortunately, there's a happy epilogue. I have incredibly close female friendships of many years which consist of 0% drama. Women are awesome friends and allies.\n\nMy conclusion to all of this is that women resort to relational aggression when they're confronted with societal rules that are meant to oppress women.

I was bullied by girls some 4 or 5 times between the ages of 11 and 18.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Age 11, a group of older girls bullied me on the bus every day, essentially because I was weird and awkward. Typical middle school crap: they&amp;#39;d rag on my clothes, my awkward mannerisms, my taste in music (anime soundtracks lol). The tried to trip me every time I got off the bus. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Age 12, a girl who was my friend the year before started picking on me in front of other girls. One time she kicked me in the butt when I was walking up the stairs in front of her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Age 12, a girl in my class was shitty to me because I had a huge crush on a guy who was a condescending douchebag to her. She and I knew each other through the guy, I didn&amp;#39;t know they had bad blood. I didn&amp;#39;t understand what the problem was at the time. She&amp;#39;d randomly say mean things to me, and one time she hid my binder and school books while I was changing in gym class. Frankly, she got over it the next year, and was actually super cool with me. I guess we all do dumb shit at 12.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Age 13, a girl who had been my friend the previous year (again!) started bullying me. One time she smeared a packet of ketchup in my hair for no reason, and then tried to beat me up in between classes. It took me too long to realize that that same guy(!) had also been a jerk to her. So basically, I was too naive and besotted to realize he was a jerk. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Age 13, My friend got angry with me for having a different religion than she did, and suddenly a rumor cropped up that I was a witchy lesbian (which, a) is hilarious to me now, and b) is at least 25% true). Our group of mutual friends stopped speaking to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Age 18: The same girl who got angry about religion slut-shamed me for having sex, and our group ostracized me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there&amp;#39;s a happy epilogue. I have incredibly close female friendships of many years which consist of 0% drama. Women are awesome friends and allies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My conclusion to all of this is that women resort to relational aggression when they&amp;#39;re confronted with societal rules that are meant to oppress women.

I don\u2019t know what to do and honestly wish karma would just take it\u2019s course but she always ends up with the longer straw. Even my dearly beloved can\u2019t stand his own sister, he refuses to talk to her but of course we run into her at family functions. We\u2019ve tried talking with her but she plays victim in every situation and we\u2019ve spoken with their mother in an attempt to remedy the situation but she protects her because the two (mother and daughter) are best friends. Although we know their mother even gets stressed out by her; but as a coping method she drinks excessive amounts when around her.\n\nLong story short here are a few examples of  my fianc\u00e9\u2019s sister being a bully or an awful person because I just need to vent. (Keep in mind she is a 23y/o female.) \n\n1. She has called me fat and ugly. \n2. She gave away our TV after she picked our lock and broke into our room when we were not home. \n3. She stole our air fryer when we were not home.\n4. She has stolen pots and pans from us.\n5. She has lied about being abused/physically attacked (we can literally prove this).\n6. She has lied about being raped (we can literally prove this). \n7. She has tried to trap her current boyfriend by attempting to get pregnant by saying she is on birth control while she actually is not.\n8. She threw a fit because both my fianc\u00e9 and I refused to let her wear white to our wedding and also refused to do a double wedding with her and her then boyfriend. (She is now engaged but her boyfriend never proposed, she told him she wanted to get married and he said okay to it.)\n9. For a brief time we did live with her, during that time my fianc\u00e9 bought a brand new desktop computer. She was upset that she could not afford one and we refused to buy one for her that she \u201cspilled\u201d juice on it when we were not home. Mind you, the computer was in our room and she was not allowed in our room (we also locked it for extra measures).\n10. She broke in and trashed our bathroom and bedroom while we were out. One of her friends that was with her who was intoxicated ended up projectile vomiting there. We were stuck cleaning that up until 2:00 in the morning while we both had work the next day.\n11. She has abused her cat previously by not providing the cat with water or food for days. She has gotten better about feeding her cat after we said something about it. She absolutely loves her cat allegedly. (Neither my fianc\u00e9 nor I would willingly let her cat starve. We have a cat of our own and have broken into her place to ensure her cat is fed.)\n12. She has not reported a hit and run (she has hit and damaged another vehicle with her own and driven off). \n13. She expects people to wait on her hand and foot. She is 23 years old I believe but I\u2019ve seen her throw a tantrum like a five year old. She has made various people cry as a result, like sales associates or waiters.\n14. She has lied about several medical issues for attention. (We have proof of this from when we briefly lived with her and were able to see medical documents.)\n15. She has asked their aunt for money for college, their aunt has written her a check (several times). Unless we say something, she ends up cashing it to buy clothes with despite her saying she needs money for books.\n16. She has failed multiple college corses and used her parents connections to either get a grade changed or a waiver.\n17. Her parents gave her a credit card since she wasn\u2019t working and she was trying to go to college (she did finally get a part time job). While she had the credit card, she would charge hundreds of dollars on clothes in one day. Her parents couldn\u2019t afford that but she would do it even if they told her not to. Then instead of returning it if something didn\u2019t fit, she would throw stuff away until I finally mentioned that she should donate it. She now donates stuff because returning it is too much work. She will also buy groceries and throw them away for dumb reasons like a can of beans is dented or she accidentally bought off brand stuff. \n18. I\u2019ve seen her tip someone at a restaurant absolutely nothing (we live in the US so tipping is customary) because she didn\u2019t like the way they were dressed.\n19. She has stated that everyone in the opposing political party from her should rot in Hell and die. \n\nThis is only a short list of the many items in which bother me.

"selftext": "Hello, I want to tell stories about bullies, this story was taken from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UNpath/comments/wp3the/i_have_questions_and_also_i_need_help/), also I need help, just go to the post where I got the stories\n\nBullies\n\nAt the beginning at fall of 2017 when i started going to a new school, there were some bullies who bullied me, parents, class teacher, teachers (maybe?) noticed it but they didn\u2019t care about it, i said that i want to be in another class or school but my parents didn\u2019t listen, because of which bullies fought and mocked me, I started mocking them\n\nThen at the end of 2018 I had some fake friends, which one of them was a bully, then in January 2019 all the bullies became fake friends, they even mocked me despite the fact that they were pretending to be friends, I mean not only hidden, perhaps in most cases open, the further the worse, I was also in love with someone, but despite this, she hated me, I stopped loving somewhere at fall of 2019-early of 2020\n\nIn December 2019, I thought that I want to leave the classroom and study only at home, I probably told my parents that I should study at home only, they and the teachers started to make me study most of all at home, maybe I'm wrong, maybe they did it themselves, idk, despite this I was still in the class but then in February 2020 there was a moment that everything changed, it was so far away that I realized that they were bullies and fake friends and that they hate me\n\nOk, let's go back, after I started to be friends with fake friends, I started to mock, that's why if there is a court they will start saying that I mocked them, they themselves taught also they were the first to mock, and now coup, they mocked me to manipulate me to make me angry and force me to do something, for example, mocking others so that they would say that I did it, but they forced me to do it, in court they will say that I am the one that I did, but in fact it was they who forced me to do it, they did it to make a fake me, then to tell my friends and laugh at me, and now another coup, this is probably a theory, but it\u2019s probably true, the percentage of it being true is 90%, in fact, that I\u2019m friends with fake friends actually i wasn't friends with them i.e. actually i didn't want to but idk probably had to do it i didn't think it was possible to just leave the class and i who was in school at fall of 2017-early of 2020, all I did was actually play a character, i.e. I probably had to do it, I didn\u2019t know that I could leave the class, and I mean not only those moments where fake friends were forced to do something, but also normal (all) moments at school, in fact I hated these people, and when there is no fake friends around, I am a different person\n\nThe fact that the former fake friends made me do something so that they tell the teacher that I did it so that I would be punished and also manipulated me to get mad to make a fake me to share with my friends so they make fun of me when even I am at school not only the moments where they made me do something but all the moments I actually played the character because I did not know that you can leave the class, I hated them, also when there was no fake friends, I was a different person and the fact that I completely changed, that I became the complete opposite of myself from 2019, and that I even have a different era in my life (I mean not 2020 -July 2022 and July 2022-January 2024 (maybe)) and the fact that they are still laughing at me and when at fall of 2021 I accidentally said out loud do you think that I am the same as from 2019, they did not understand, laughed and did not perceive seriously, it's just so terrible\n\nAnyway I'll say that the whole class is a bullies, they bully each other but they have some kind of group of people who support him (I mean terrible ones who are also bullies, and apparently it also includes several from my classes) but everyone hated me, there were a few moments from fall of 2017-early 2020 that were too terrible, for example, at fall of 2017 I accidentally waved my hand which hit bully's egg, as a result of which it became ill, they accused me but I speak l that I accidentally did it but they didn\u2019t listen and treated me terribly and mocked me, or when in 2018 when they weren\u2019t fake friends, one of the bully just made me wave my hand at the phone case of some kind of bully that fell and then they started blaming me, in fact, my hand was near the phone case of some kind of bully, that is, it did not hit the phone case of some kind of bully, in fact, one of the bully dropped phone case of some kind of bully, even the same bully who damaged the phone case of some kind of bully, accidentally said in the lesson that he had ruined it and then everyone or several or a lot looked at him, but they still blamed me, I know that this was one of the plans, bullies (the whole class) there were always plans\n\nOne of the fake friends ordered or asked me to give him money, he also deceived that he bought or shared something, but in fact he didn\u2019t buy or share anything, also person that I was in love, bullies ordered to bully or do something with them, I also mocked him, I will say that person that I was in love is from my class, yes, this is bully, so just a terrible person as the whole class and with friends who they are friends, there is also a theory that several girls fell in love with me, again from my class, so these were fake lovers, and they wanted to deceive me, but then it all ended, the percentage that this could be true is 70%\n\nBullies is the main reason why my life is from to it is 2017-early 2020 spoiled, in February 2020\n\nFake friends will have to pour water into the pencil case of some kind of bully, in the end, after the water was poured from the pencil case, the pencil case still had the water left, and maybe there was something wrong with the pencil case, in the end at that moment they blamed me, but in fact it was fake friends who forced to do this, even fake friends are did this, in the end after that the class teacher, the teacher made it so that I only studied at home teaching, when I was at the lesson and the teachers were not there, one of the fake friends said that he didn\u2019t like what one of the fake friends was doing and that some person made other people do this (a person, I mean students, that is, bully), when I asked what about me, he said that I'm just autistic, bullies mocked me because I was autistic but in fact I was not autistic, there is a theory that in the first day i went to a new school, one of the bully said you will be friends with me?, i just turned away, and maybe this is the reason or one of the reasons why they bullied me, the percentage that this is true is 40-90%\n\nIn fact even though the whole class is bullies, at fall of 2017-2019, no, the whole class has always been bullies, but in fact it was better, that is, it was not like it is now, and there were earlier bullies, which hated the main bullies but I could be wrong now they have turned into who they hated\n\nMy parents said I stayed in the class but the class teacher said it was so far away that I should only homeschool even after I started to study only at home, there were some moments that the bullies mocked me\n\nI forgot to say that there were several or many moments where they mocked, but I even did not realize it, for example, where did they say: you is adopted?, I didn\u2019t know what is adopted, when I called myself a bachelor, but I thought that this was a man who loved many girls of him, etc, and they laughed, in fact, a bachelor is a man without a partner\n\nAt fall of 2020 I had to study in the classroom because the class teacher, the teachers and maybe the director made my home school schedule, but I pretended to be friends with the bullies (I mean not that I said that I was friends with them, but that I pretended to be friends), that is, this time it's not even a theory and completely true, they said that I had changed but in fact they thought everything was the same as me from 2019, everything only got worse\n\nIn 2019-early 2020 bullies started calling me dove and still call it, also at fall of 2020 they began to joke something with me and that bully that I hated the most, for example, he told bully to poke me with his handles because I love him, obviously this is not true, also he insulted my mother by recalling insulting names, also they called me Vladimir Putin and still call me, a few weeks before I again began to study only at home education, I began slowly stop being friends (which was actually a pretense), first with the most important then on the second, at some point or two I may or may not accidentally or not quietly called him terrible, at some point they laughed, they don\u2019t even care when people tell the truth about bullies when they call him terrible, at some point they were surprised, when the main bully came to say hello (obviously this is not true since they are fake friends and bullies), I ignored it, he was surprised, I ignored it, he was surprised, in fact they forgot about it\n\nI forgot to say that I fought with them when they made me angry and these are even ordinary moments, also they also fought with me\n\nIn some or many moments I ran away from school because I did not want to study with the class, in November 2020 the class teacher, parents, the director made me study only at home, but only I have to come for 2 more lessons with classes, after the lessons with classes, I again started studying only at home, but even after that there were some moments at fall of 2020 that bullies laughed at me\n\nThen at fall of 2021 bullies started laughing at me on the street, although before that there were some moments that was on the street but this is when I was with fake friends who obviously mocked me, near the school, but also there were also several moments that bully filmed me on the street even when I was with my mother, bullies always filmed me at fall of 2017-fall 2020 at school, near the school even don't look at the fact that I didn\u2019t like it, but this time on any streets, they don\u2019t care, I\u2019ll walk with my mother or with others, they laugh anyway, there was also a moment where they threw bottles at me, but they missed, I heard their laughter, the bottle was vodka which they usually drink, so this is another proof that they are\n\nI also forgot to say that the bullies told their parents that I was bad, when there was some moment where the bullies as always to blame, the class teacher tried to call the parents of one of the bully, but even they ignored\n\nI also just realized (that is, right now while writing this post) the fact that the former math teacher or teachers also mocked me, probably for classes, the former math teacher was expelled because of some terrible moments (not connected with me)\n\nAlso the parents, the class teacher hated what bullies doing but they supported and at fall of 2020-2021 or 2022 when the teacher or idk did the bullies punishment they deserved or idk, parents said that bullies are not angels but they don\u2019t deserve that the one who punished bullies is to blame for everything, so, it\u2019s also possible it\u2019s not true, but it\u2019s probably true\n\nBullies approach the school guard or people who worked on the exam or idk, etc and said something, I think they do it so that I didn\u2019t succeed, so maybe because this the marks on the exam were lowered, this is very terrible, also maybe they said something to the director, etc, so that my parents and I could not succeed, therefore, perhaps because of this, the director does not agree with my parents and may go against my parents\n\nAt early of 2022 there were some moments where the main bully tried to be friends with me (obviously they are actually trying to cheat) but I ignored\n\nIn the spring-summer of 2022 there were many moments with bullies and his friends where they laughed on the streets, so, one of the moments where they laughed at me, one of the phrases was: they mocked, then they probably talked about the arrow, all bullies and his friends are \u0410\u0423\u0415 (Russian gangster), but the main audience of \u0410\u0423\u0415 now is teenagers who show off more than commit crimes, all bullies and his friends show off more than commit crimes, also that one of the bully where she talked about the shooter she were friends with two boys, maybe they are their partners, she is also a tomboy, there were some moments where these two boys laughed at me maybe even in 2020, but they are much worse, I think that the bullies and his friends want to be like columbine, columbine consisted of two boys, this is another proof\n\nThere was also a moment where one of the bully or their friends filmed me when I was near the windows of my apartment, but if you look closely then maybe it was not them and he or she filmed herself but maybe it was one of the bulliy or their friends who filmed me when I was near the windows of my apartment\n\nAlso the bullies and their friends often come to the playgrounds or the football field near my house, this is probably for the sake of irony, that is, they hate me so much and doesn't take me seriously that even for the sake of a joke they go near my house, in the summer of 2021 (probably) one of the bully called the intercom to ask how I was doing but it\u2019s obvious that this is actually a deception and I ignored it\n\nI also forgot to say that another bully fell in love with me at fall of 2020 and some bully gave me the paper that the bully who was in love with me, I didn\u2019t read and threw away, it\u2019s obvious that she wanted to deceive, it happened after the moment that the whole class was in class, I looked at the blackboards or directly (probably), she thought that I I don\u2019t pay attention to him because I love, but in fact she just annoyed me\n\nAlso at the end of 2020 I was friends with some person from another class, I think this is another fake friend because I realized that he was friends with bullies, in December 2020 or early 2021 I stopped being friends, since December 2020 there was no moment with him, that is, I didn\u2019t see him\n\nAlso bullies writes my name on the benches which is located on the playgrounds near my house, maybe there was not just my name but also bullying with me\n\nAt the Russian language exam, the Russian language teacher said that my classes would not be there but in the end they were there, maybe she didn\u2019t know that my classes would be there, but I think it was bullies who said the teacher in Russian to did it so that I didn\u2019t succeed, it was very bad inside me because at early or in March 2022 I said on social media that if I have more moments with bullies (I thought that it was a moment for the exam, but in fact that how bullies laughs in front of me, that\u2019s it too moments with bullies, maybe I meant big moment with bullies, idk) then I will kill myself, why didn\u2019t I kill myself, I ignored bullies\n\nAlso my mom even though she knows that they bullied me, she still went to the photo shoot (where they shoot the cover) because I don\u2019t want to go (obviously because I don\u2019t want to go with the class), also she talked to the bullies, now she is friends with the mother of the main bully, I will be silent, the bullies said that they will not laugh, that they have changed and when I come, they will be glad, it is obvious that this is a deception, if you look at their social media, you can to see that they have not changed, also when I came to the Russian language exams they did not pay attention to me, also they laughed and joked about me\n\nIn the spring-summer of 2022 they started calling me a derogatory name that they recall other bullies that I hate the most, anyway I will say that they probably compared me with those bully that I hate the most I hate probably this in order to make me angry, now they call me an offensive name that other bully recall which I hate the most, that is, I am not me, I am is that bully that I hate the most\n\nLately the bullies has become so terrible that it is already out of control\n\nIn July 2022 one of the bully came by twice the door of my apartment, my brother didn\u2019t allow he to go, he said that doesn't let an stranger out, in any case, I\u2019ll say that bully didn\u2019t talk about me, he said that this was his apartment and that he needed to go in, but when my brother said that this was not his apartment, then he he apologizes and said that he would not come again and then later he came again and said that this was his apartment and that he needed to come in, his voice was like that bully who cheated me with money, maybe it was not him, but I think it was him, I forgot to say that in 2019-early 2020 he also tore my money, when he came into near the door of my apartment, he knocked, probably there were some or many moments where they knocked on near the doors of my apartment, maybe this is not true but I think it's true, probably bully often comes to the door of my apartment to steal something or do something, maybe he came to kill me, I have a theory that the bullis want to kill me\n\nAlso the bullies screamed on the stairs (maybe?) when my dad left door of my apartment, the bullies didn\u2019t give a damn about what he does and now they're out of control\n\nWhen i went on vacation there was one of the bully that was on the train but that might not be true if you look back then it didn't look like him, also when I driving in the train, I saw a bully who was filming another bully showing the middle finger on the train I was on, also when people said something there was the same surname that was like that of the bully, in fact it was later replaced in early 2020-spring 2020, this is the one that was at fall of 2017-early 2020, it looks like they changed it back to this, also the surname that he changed was probably for the sake of irony, that is, something connected with Putin, but something else, they again did it for the sake of a joke, also on some night where I was sleeping, I heard a scream that bullies usually makes, it looks like it was a bully or bullies who screamed even when I was in grandmother's house in rest, it's so terrible, also at the station when I wanted to go on vacation, there were police or guards who said something about \u0434\u0430\u0443\u043d (Russian insult), bulles like to joke something about \u0434\u0430\u0443\u043d and probably the main sense was about me, also dad one of the bully is the police, this is one of reasons why I don't get in touch with the Russian state, because the bullies and their parents will blame me and eventually they can put me in jail, it's so terrible, these plans from the bullies just got out of control, percent the fact that this is true (about the fact that the dad of one of the bully is the police is completely true) is 40-90%\n\nI also want to say that there were moments where bullies and their parents violated the laws, for example, I saw some kind of bully with their parents with the police, if you look it looks like they broke the rule, also one of the bully in the groups posted a video where he broke the rule and possibly they said that their police stopped him\n\nAlso the bullies are engaged in cyberbullying and I found a lot of things, cyberbullying includes: dove (as you know, this is a mockery of me), photos of friends who look like me, etc, also they had videos where was homophobic, racist, I mean that they are homophobic, racist, racist, I mean that they hate the usa and say that russia is a good country, also they are probably friends with people who support the war russia against ukraine, there are also theories that include spam on youtube where there is also an insult but it\u2019s not me but another bully\n\nAlso when bullies talked or played games with bullies, they did something with other bully and he or she cried and the bullies laughed\n\nAlso the bully says that I am the same as the bully that I hate the most, and says that I am still in love with the bullis that I stopped liking at early of 2020, they also joke about it, it's so terrible\n\nAs you can see the bullies are people who pretended to be friends to force me to do something to punish me, manipulated me to get angry to create a fake me to laugh when even I'm at school at the end of 2017-early of 2020 it was all just acting out a character because I didn't know that it was possible to leave the class, also their plans got out of control, violated the laws, and if the theory turns out to be true then also they make so that the Russian state blame me\n\nMaybe there were other things

2020 spoiled, in February 2020&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fake friends will have to pour water into the pencil case of some kind of bully, in the end, after the water was poured from the pencil case, the pencil case still had the water left, and maybe there was something wrong with the pencil case, in the end at that moment they blamed me, but in fact it was fake friends who forced to do this, even

said you will be friends with me?, i just turned away, and maybe this is the reason or one of the reasons why they bullied me, the percentage that this is true is 40-90%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact even though the whole class is bullies, at fall of 2017-2019, no, the whole class has always been bullies, but in fact it was better, that is, it was not like it is now, and there were earlier bullies, which hated the main bullies but I could be wrong now they have turned into who they hated&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My parents said I stayed in the class but the class teacher said it was so far away that I should only homeschool even after I started to study only at home, there were some moments that the bullies mocked me&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I forgot to say that there were several or many moments where they mocked, but I even did not realize it, for example, where did they say: you is adopted?, I didn\u2019t know what is adopted, when I called myself a bachelor, but I thought that this was a man who loved many girls of him, etc, and they laughed, in fact, a bachelor is a man without a partner&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At fall of 2020 I had to study in the classroom because the class teacher, the teachers and maybe the director made my home school schedule, but I pretended to be friends with the bullies (I mean not that I said that I was friends with them, but that I pretended to be friends), that is, this time it&amp;#39;s not even a theory and completely true, they said that I had changed but in fact they thought everything was the same as me from 2019, everything only got worse&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2019-early 2020 bullies started calling me dove and still call it, also at fall of 2020 they began to joke something with me and that bully that I hated the most, for example, he told bully to poke me with his handles because I love him, obviously this is not true, also he insulted my mother by recalling insulting names, also they called me Vladimir Putin and still call me, a few weeks before I again began to study only at home education, I began slowly stop being friends (which was actually a pretense), first with the most important then on the second, at some point or two I may or may not accidentally or not quietly called him terrible, at some point they laughed, they don\u2019t even care when people tell the truth about bullies when they call him terrible, at some point they were surprised, when the main bully came to say hello (obviously this is not true since they are fake friends and bullies), I ignored it, he was surprised, I ignored it, he was surprised, in fact they forgot about it&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I forgot to say that I fought with them when they made me angry and these are even ordinary moments, also they also fought with me&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In some or many moments I ran away from school because I did not want to study with the class, in November 2020 the class teacher, parents, the director made me study only at home, but only I have to come for 2 more lessons with classes, after the lessons with classes, I again started studying only at home, but even after that there were some moments at fall of 2020 that bullies laughed at me&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then at fall of 2021 bullies started laughing at me on the street, although before that there were some moments that was on the street but this is when I was with fake friends who obviously mocked me, near the school, but also there were also several moments that bully filmed me on the street even when I was with my mother, bullies always filmed me at fall of 2017-fall 2020 at school, near the school even don&amp;#39;t look at the fact that I didn\u2019t like it, but this time on any streets, they don\u2019t care, I\u2019ll walk with my mother or with others, they laugh anyway, there was also a moment where they threw bottles at me, but they missed, I heard their laughter, the bottle was vodka which they usually drink, so this is another proof that they are&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also forgot to say that the bullies told their parents that I was bad, when there was some moment where the bullies as always to blame, the class teacher tried to call the parents of one of the bully, but even they ignored&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also just realized (that is, right now while writing this post) the fact that the former math teacher or teachers also mocked me, probably for classes, the former math teacher was expelled because of some terrible moments (not connected with me)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also the parents, the class teacher hated what bullies doing but they supported and at fall of 2020-2021 or 2022 when the teacher or idk did the bullies punishment they deserved or idk, parents said that bullies are not angels but they don\u2019t deserve that the one who punished bullies is to blame for everything, so, it\u2019s also possible it\u2019s not true, but it\u2019s probably true&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bullies approach the school guard or people who worked on the exam or idk, etc and said something, I think they do it so that I didn\u2019t succeed, so maybe because this the marks on the exam were lowered, this is very terrible, also maybe they said something to the director, etc, so that my parents and I could not succeed, therefore, perhaps because of this, the director does not agree with my parents and may go against my parents&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At early of 2022 there were some moments where the main bully tried to be friends with me (obviously they are actually trying to cheat) but I ignored&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the spring-summer of 2022 there were many moments with bullies and his friends where they laughed on the streets, so, one of the moments where they laughed at me, one of the phrases was: they mocked, then they probably talked about the arrow, all bullies and his friends are \u0410\u0423\u0415 (Russian gangster), but the main audience of \u0410\u0423\u0415 now is teenagers who show off more than commit crimes, all bullies and his friends show off more than commit crimes, also that one of the bully where she talked about the shooter she were friends with two boys, maybe they are their partners, she is also a tomboy, there were some moments where these two boys laughed at me maybe even in 2020, but they are much worse, I think that the bullies and his friends want to be like columbine, columbine consisted of two boys, this is another proof&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was also a moment where one of the bully or their friends filmed me when I was near the windows of my apartment, but if you look closely then maybe it was not them and he or she filmed herself but maybe it was one of the bulliy or their friends who filmed me when I was near the windows of my apartment&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also the bullies and their friends often come to the playgrounds or the football field near my house, this is probably for the sake of irony, that is, they hate me so much and doesn&amp;#39;t take me seriously that even for the sake of a joke they go near my house, in the summer of 2021 (probably) one of the bully called the intercom to ask how I was doing but it\u2019s obvious that this is actually a deception and I ignored it&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also forgot to say that another bully fell in love with me at fall of 2020 and some bully gave me the paper that the bully who was in love with me, I didn\u2019t read and threw away, it\u2019s obvious that she wanted to deceive, it happened after the moment that the whole class was in class, I looked at the blackboards or directly (probably), she thought that I I don\u2019t pay attention to him because I love, but in fact she just annoyed me&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also at the end of 2020 I was friends with some person from another class, I think this is another fake friend because I realized that he was friends with bullies, in December 2020 or early 2021 I stopped being friends, since December 2020 there was no moment with him, that is, I didn\u2019t see him&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also bullies writes my name on the benches which is located on the playgrounds near my house, maybe there was not just my name but also bullying with me&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the Russian language exam, the Russian language teacher said that my classes would not be there but in the end they were there, maybe she didn\u2019t know that my classes would be there, but I think it was bullies who said the teacher in Russian to did it so that I didn\u2019t succeed, it was very bad inside me because at early or in March 2022 I said on social media that if I have more moments with bullies (I thought that it was a moment for the exam, but in fact that how bullies laughs in front of me, that\u2019s it too moments with bullies, maybe I meant big moment with bullies, idk) then I will kill myself, why didn\u2019t I kill myself, I ignored bullies&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also my mom even though she knows that they bullied me, she still went to the photo shoot (where they shoot the cover) because I don\u2019t want to go (obviously because I don\u2019t want to go with the class), also she talked to the bullies, now she is friends with the mother of the main bully, I will be silent, the bullies said that they will not laugh, that they have changed and when I come, they will be glad, it is obvious that this is a deception, if you look at their social media, you can to see that they have not changed, also when I came to the Russian language exams they did not pay attention to me, also they laughed and joked about me&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the spring-summer of 2022 they started calling me a derogatory name that they recall other bullies that I hate the most, anyway I will say that they probably compared me with those bully that I hate the most I hate probably this in order to make me angry, now they call me an offensive name that other bully recall which I hate the most, that is, I am not me, I am is that bully that I hate the most&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lately the bullies has become so terrible that it is already out of control&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In July 2022 one of the bully came by twice the door of my apartment, my brother didn\u2019t allow he to go, he said that doesn&amp;#39;t let an stranger out, in any case, I\u2019ll say that bully didn\u2019t talk about me, he said that this was his apartment and that he needed to go in, but when my brother said that this was not his apartment, then he he apologizes and said that he would not come again and then later he came again and said that this was his apartment and that he needed to come in, his voice was like that bully who cheated me with money, maybe it was not him, but I think it was him, I forgot to say that in 2019-early 2020 he also tore my money, when he came into near the door of my apartment, he knocked, probably there were some or many moments where they knocked on near the doors of my apartment, maybe this is not true but I think it&amp;#39;s true, probably bully often comes to the door of my apartment to steal something or do something, maybe he came to kill me, I have a theory that the bullis want to kill me&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also the bullies screamed on the stairs (maybe?) when my dad left door of my apartment, the bullies didn\u2019t give a damn about what he does and now they&amp;#39;re out of control&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When i went on vacation there was one of the bully that was on the train but that might not be true if you look back then it didn&amp;#39;t look like him, also when I driving in the train, I saw a bully who was filming another bully showing the middle finger on the train I was on, also when people said something there was the same surname that was like that of the bully, in fact it was later replaced in early 2020-spring 2020, this is the one that was at fall of 2017-early 2020, it looks like they changed it back to this, also the surname that he changed was probably for the sake of irony, that is, something connected with Putin, but something else, they again did it for the sake of a joke, also on some night where I was sleeping, I heard a scream that bullies usually makes, it looks like it was a bully or bullies who screamed even when I was in grandmother&amp;#39;s house in rest, it&amp;#39;s so terrible, also at the station when I wanted to go on vacation, there were police or guards who said something about \u0434\u0430\u0443\u043d (Russian insult), bulles like to joke something about \u0434\u0430\u0443\u043d and probably the main sense was about me, also dad one of the bully is the police, this is one of reasons why I don&amp;#39;t get in touch with the Russian state, because the bullies and their parents will blame me and eventually they can put me in jail, it&amp;#39;s so terrible, these plans from the bullies just got out of control, percent the fact that this is true (about the fact that the dad of one of the bully is the police is completely true) is 40-90%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also want to say that there were moments where bullies and their parents violated the laws, for example, I saw some kind of bully with their parents with the police, if you look it looks like they broke the rule, also one of the bully in the groups posted a video where he broke the rule and possibly they said that their police stopped him&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also the bullies are engaged in cyberbullying and I found a lot of things, cyberbullying includes: dove (as you know, this is a mockery of me), photos of friends who look like me, etc, also they had videos where was homophobic, racist, I mean that they are homophobic, racist, racist, I mean that they hate the usa and say that russia is a good country, also they are probably friends with people who support the war russia against ukraine, there are also theories that include spam on youtube where there is also an insult but it\u2019s not me but another bully&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also when bullies talked or played games with bullies, they did something with other bully and he or she cried and the bullies laughed&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also the bully says that I am the same as the bully that I hate the most, and says that I am still in love with the bullis that I stopped liking at early of 2020, they also joke about it, it&amp;#39;s so terrible&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see the bullies are people who pretended to be friends to force me to do something to punish me, manipulated me to get angry to create a fake me to laugh when even I&amp;#39;m at school at the end of 2017-early of 2020 it was all just acting out a character because I didn&amp;#39;t know that it was possible to leave the class, also their plans got out of control, violated the laws, and if the theory turns out to be true then also they make so that the Russian state blame me&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe there were other things that I can&amp;#39;t remember but they are important too&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null,

A new girl joined my friendship group. This girl will be called Tara for confidentiality. Me and Tara got on well because we had similar interests. Tara wasn't in school due to COVID related reasons and she joined the friendship group due to one of her friends, Jade, being in it. Jade was annoyed by the fact that everyone seemed to really like Tara. Jade would go out of her way to be rude and leave Tara out of things. This went on for most of the year and me and my friend Sasha just got on with it. During the start of the next year Sasha started defending Tara more and more and Jade was frequently annoyed by this. It got to the point where Jade would start bullying Sasha because of this. I was completely unaware of this because I was sitting with other friends at lunch and break to avoid the arguments. Jade would follow Sasha around and verbally harass her when I wasn't around. This would never happen if I was around. This is likely due to the fact that she saw me as a threat and that if Sasha was alone she wouldn\u2019t be able to defend herself. This eventually got found out by Sasha\u2019s older sister seeing what was happening and confronting Jade about it while she completely denied any of it. Unfortunately, mine and Sasha\u2019s friend since year 5, Alice, stayed with Jade after the ultimate break up of the group. This destroyed me as she thought that Alice was my friend. Looking back on it after, however, I realised that Jade was very good at manipulating people and that Alice went with Jade because she wasn\u2019t strong enough to speak for herself. Me and Sasha went to the school many times about this but they never did anything about it. Her parents too. They didn\u2019t believe us when they said that Jade could be a bully. This meant that she went free after bullying multiple people for months. Me and Sasha became eachother\u2019s only friends in that school while Jade seemed to gain them. \nSasha let it go quickly and said that it was in the past and didn\u2019t matter anymore. Me, however, I was left angry and felt angry at the school for the clear injustice that had been shown against my friend. I was surprised at how my friend had brushed it off so quickly while I was left feeling angry and betrayed by the school for dismissing the issue so quickly when there were so many people that had witnessed Jade\u2019s behaviour. They claimed that they were going to support her as much as us. As of now, I have lost all trust in the school due to their treatment of the situation. I don\u2019t believe that they are capable of dealing with bullying appropriately. This really negatively affected me as I\u2019ve completely lost trust in me school, lost many friends I thought I could trust, my best friend\u2019s bully was not brought to justice and came out better than me. I also now struggle with sudden moments of anger and memories about the situation and when these moments happen I find it difficult to stay engaged in my school work and talking to people. These moments often ruin my day and conversations with others. This experience turned me into a very angry person and I struggle to show my emotions about it properly.\n\nIn general I really can\u2019t wait to leave that terrible school. Only one more year to go, thank goodness :)\n\nIf you made it this far thank you so much.

I\u2019ve had this bully since about 5th grade, and she hasn\u2019t left me alone since. She\u2019ll make comments about absolutely anything from my body to my friends. And sometimes she\u2019ll punch me. She makes me cry at school almost everyday. Typical middle school bully style. Her dad actually teaches at this school. I go to a private school, and the teachers always say that they don\u2019t believe me because she\u2019s a \u201cgood kid.\u201d Also, as a little background, I have anxiety. I\u2019ve always been open about it, hoping to make it less taboo. I want people to feel comfortable talk about it, and if they need to talk to someone, they can talk to me. My bully has always told me that since I\u2019m showing I\u2019m hurting, I\u2019m weak and that everyone deserves to hate me. On our first day of school, we were playing a game in class where we had to be on a team together. While we were doing this, I noticed something. Up and down her wrists and thighs, she had slit marks. They were definitely new. I didn\u2019t say anything about it, but I realized something. I never knew why she wanted me to hurt so badly.

And sometimes she\u2019ll punch me. She makes me cry at school almost everyday. Typical middle school bully style. Her dad actually teaches at this school. I go to a private school, and the teachers always say that they don\u2019t believe me because she\u2019s a \u201cgood kid.\u201d Also, as a little background, I have anxiety. I\u2019ve always been open about it, hoping to make it less taboo. I want people to feel comfortable talk about it, and if they need to talk to someone, they can talk to me. My bully has always told me that since I\u2019m showing I\u2019m hurting, I\u2019m weak and that everyone deserves to hate me. On our first day of school, we were playing a game in class where we had to be on a team together. While we were doing this, I noticed something. Up and down her wrists and thighs, she had slit marks. They were definitely new. I didn\u2019t say anything about it, but I realized something. I never knew why she wanted me to hurt so badly.

Screw title. And my aim is much bigger then she can imagine.\n\nWhen she worked at base 2, she said she was bullied and mistreated so she changed but now I understand that the personel at that base weren't the issue, it was her.\n\nEver since she got promoted, she has had her eyes keenly on me:\n\nShe has bullied me: if I have had other duties and she would try to load another on me, I would ask for a moment as I had another priority, her eyes would flame up and she would tell me no, causing me to not be able to do my job right, and furthermore give me anxiety. \n\nIntruded my private space and has threatened to report me for talking to a colleague: I work as an online teacher as well, teaching English, and German and I do it for fun as I love helping people with their language skills and the little extra cash helps a lot. And she has mentioned to me many times how my main job is with the airline, I shouldn't do it, it is tiring me. When she doesn't even know how much it gives me energy when I do it once a day. Then when talking to a colleague, she goes and asks her what we spoke about! As if it is her business. She has threatened to report me because apparently I do however my mind chooses: DO IT, I DON'T CARE!\n\nShe never offers to help, she doesn't have any good relations with people at work, she has no friends outside of work other than her cat. And she tries to bash me whenever I explain to a colleague that I am doing something new. Like archery and so on.\n\nShe goes around telling us 'pay attention to the customer' when we have over 7000 a week, how can one on a minutely basis talk to customers. Even the customers get sick of it at the departure area.\n\nFurthermore, she must always have control over anything, even if I go to the restroom, she must give permission. She is Napoleon, reborn. Must micromanage every single footstep.\n\nShe has no leadership skills, she doesn't know how to motivate a team, nor does she know how to use it effectively. She is unable to organise anything in the airport. Her job is as customer helper but she's no different from a video game NPC that stands in one place the entire game and says the same thing. \n\nWe are also told not to use phones at work in the eyes of the customers and if one shift is 8 hours, 6 of which are before the customers, she is on her phone for ay least 5.9 hours of it and then disappears to the office for no reason.\n\nShe loads her own duties on to me and other's.\n\nEvery small mistake she must report. Even if I spill water she must report this. She doesn't understand the fact that there is something called human factors on aviation. \n\nMe and the other senior colleagues (me being the oldest after my duty manager and supervisor (we  have two, one is great, the one I'm ranting about is another)) are like-minded and she has the audacity to blame everything on others in the airport as if she knows how things are run. None of us feel the need to ask her anything, as we seriously already know more than she does as she makes no single effort to learn more. Then tells me and others we don't do enough and compares us to other bases and asks advice as if we need it.\n\nThen she reports all these mishaps and informs the regional manager which she has now painted a bad picture of me for him. We have 1 to 1's now, (after waiting 5 months) and I already know what to expect.\n\nTwo days ago I went to my girlfriend and said: this has made me depressed. I feel mobbed  drained and tired. It's currently 5am and I can't sleep.\n\nIn the past 5 years of the job, it was fun, stressful but fun, everyday was a laugh. Now it has become nothing but ash and smoke.\n\nI'm thinking of writing an extensive safety report about her on the airline's system for abuse. \n\nThank you to anyone who has taken the time to read this.\n\nHave a great morning/day/evening/night.", "author_fullname": "t2_2x1rml66", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Bullied at Work", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bullying", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_wd5idz", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1659319744.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.bullying", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I work for an airline, Jet2.com to be specific but I won&amp;#39;t say where.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve worked with the airline for 6 years now and have had some amazing memories. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this year someone who had only began the year before at another base (let&amp;#39;s call it base 1) for one month whom then transferred to my base (base 2) last year and worked as normal for 1,5 months was promoted to Supervisor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t care she has been promoted, I&amp;#39;m only 20 odd years old, I have so many possibilities.

When she doesn&amp;#39;t even know how much it gives me energy when I do it once a day. Then when talking to a colleague, she goes and asks her what we spoke about! As if it is her business. She has threatened to report me because apparently I do however my mind chooses: DO IT, I DON&amp;#39;T CARE!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She never offers to help, she doesn&amp;#39;t have any good relations with people at work, she has no friends outside of work other than her cat. And she tries to bash me whenever I explain to a colleague that I am doing something new. Like archery and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She goes around telling us &amp;#39;pay attention to the customer&amp;#39; when we have over 7000 a week, how can one on a minutely basis talk to customers. Even the customers get sick of it at the departure area.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, she must always have control over anything, even if I go to the restroom, she must give permission. She is Napoleon, reborn. Must micromanage every single footstep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She has no leadership skills, she doesn&amp;#39;t know how to motivate a team, nor does she know how to use it effectively. She is unable to organise anything in the airport. Her job is as customer helper but she&amp;#39;s no different from a video game NPC that stands in one place the entire game and says the same thing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are also told not to use phones at work in the eyes of the customers and if one shift is 8 hours, 6 of which are before the customers, she is on her phone for ay least 5.9 hours of it and then disappears to the office for no reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She loads her own duties on to me and other&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every small mistake she must report. Even if I spill water she must report this. She doesn&amp;#39;t understand the fact that there is something called human factors on aviation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me and the other senior colleagues (me being the oldest after my duty manager and supervisor (we  have two, one is great, the one I&amp;#39;m ranting about is another)) are like-minded and she has the audacity to blame everything on others in the airport as if she knows how things are run. None of us feel the need to ask her anything, as we seriously already know more than she does as she makes no single effort to learn more. Then tells me and others we don&amp;#39;t do enough and compares us to other bases and asks advice as if we need it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then she reports all these mishaps and informs the regional manager which she has now painted a bad picture of me for him. We have 1 to 1&amp;#39;s now, (after waiting 5 months) and I already know what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two days ago I went to my girlfriend and said: this has made me depressed. I feel mobbed  drained and tired. It&amp;#39;s currently 5am and I can&amp;#39;t sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the past 5 years of the job, it was fun, stressful but fun, everyday was a laugh. Now it has become nothing but ash and smoke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m thinking of writing an extensive safety report about her on the airline&amp;#39;s system for abuse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you to anyone who has taken the time to read this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have a great morning/day/evening/night.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sw9l", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "wd5idz", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Aranzilla", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 6, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/bullying/comments/wd5idz/bullied_at_work/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/wd5idz/bullied_at_work/", "subreddit_subscribers": 7766, "created_utc": 1659319744.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "bullying", "selftext": "Have you ever had others defend your bullies by claiming they're just \"tough\" (or \"hardcore\") and made you the guilty one for refusing to accept and tolerate that?
