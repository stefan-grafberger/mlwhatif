And I feel amazing about it. And you can make it happen too. But go to actual therapy first. I don\u2019t want the burden of your livelihood on my hands. I just wanna help as much as I can so YOU can carry your own weight moving forward. Don\u2019t depend on me if you reach out to me and find I\u2019m helping you, is what I\u2019m tryna say. Be cognizant about who or what you tend to depend on. Make the only thing you depend on be your own self. It takes hard work and honesty.\n2. I would want to FaceTime or something eventually so we can have a real connection.\n3. I can only help people who are 100% committed to bettering themselves. This means that almost 24/7 all they\u2019re thinking about is how they can be a better version of themselves. EVEN if all they\u2019re doing is laying in bed smoking weed and goin thru it. I have been there. I have seen the worst in myself and it\u2019s scary. But I have also seen the best in myself and the rest of humanity. And that\u2019s what matters most.\n\nTake my hand. Let me help you through this.\n\nOtherwise, Godspeed. Enjoy your journey as much as you fucking can, no matter how much it feels like you\u2019re walkin thru the eternal flames of hell. Do what you can to make it right, to make it all worth it. Never stop trying. Never. **Each and every one of us has it in us to be the versions of ourselves we have always dreamt of being**. This isn\u2019t just optimistic life advice. This is a truth of life. If you don\u2019t agree with that, I urge you to journal or have a discussion with someone about it. Ask the question: \u201cCan we really do ANYTHING we set our minds to? Where do our limits lie?\u201d and you\u2019ll find some limits for sure.

\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nX Personal Control Beliefs\n\nThe strength with which people try to exercise personal control can be traced to the strengths of their expectancies of being able to do so. Expectancy is a subjective prediction of how likely it is that an event will occur. Two types of expectancies exist: efficacy and outcome (Bandura, 1977, 1986, 1997; Heckhausen, 1977; Peterson Maier, &amp; Seligman 1993). An efficacy expectation (see Figure 10.1) is a judgment of one\u2019s capacity to execute a particular act or course of action. The question is, \u201cCan I do it?\u201d An outcome expectation (see Figure 10.1) is a judgment that a given action, once performed, will cause a particular outcome. The question is, \u201cWill it work?\u201d Take away either of these positive forecasts, and reluctance and avoidance become rather logical ways of acting. While \u201cpersonal control beliefs\u201d is a wide-ranging topic, much of its essence can be seen in how we cope with failure. To function competently when failure comes our way, we need to be not disrupted by it but instead use what it is telling us so that we can enhance our progress in whatever it is we are trying to do. Most importantly, we can appraise (interpret) a failure episode as either a challenge or a threat (Skinner &amp; Wellborn, 1997). Failure as challenge means we understand the meaning of failure as an opportunity for growth and learning. Thinking this way, we tend to cope in mastery-oriented ways, and this empowering coping style leads to adaptive functioning and outcomes. Failure as threat means we understand the meaning of failure as a danger to our well-being\u2014something is wrong with us that has caused the failure to happen. Thinking this way, we tend to cope in defensive, self-protective ways, and this debilitating coping style leads to maladaptive functioning and outcomes. Competent functioning requires not only possessing skills (i.e., ability), but also the capacity to translate those skills into effective performance, especially under trying and difficult circumstances. Self-efficacy is just as important a determinant of competent functioning as is ability because performance situations often are stressful, ambiguous, and unpredictable, and as one performs, circumstances always change (Bandura, 1997). The opposite of efficacy is doubt. Extent of self-efficacy (vs. self-doubt) is the motivational variable that determines the extent to which a performer copes well (vs. poorly) when her skills and abilities are stressed. The extent to which a person believes she can competently enact a particular course of action stems from her personal history of trying to enact that course of action in the past (Bandura, 1986, 1997; Bandura, Reese, &amp; Adams, 1982). People learn their current self-efficacy from their interpretations and memories of past attempts to execute the same behavior. Memories and recollections judged as competent raise self-efficacy, whereas memories and recollections judged as incompetent lower self-efficacy. Competent enactment will not raise a strong sense of inefficacy much). If the performer is less experienced (i.e., lacks a behavioral history), however, each new competent or incompetent enactment will rather substantially inform future efficacy. Of the four sources of self- efficacy, personal behavior history is the most influential (Bandura, 1986). Seeing others perform masterfully raises the observer\u2019s own sense of efficacy (Bandura, Adams, Hardy, &amp; Howells, 1980; Kazdin, 1979). But vicarious experience works the other way as well, because observing others perform the same behavior clumsily lowers our own sense of efficacy. First, the greater the similarity between the model and the observer, the greater the impact the model\u2019s behavior will have on the observer\u2019s own efficacy forecast (Schunk, 1989b). Second, the less experienced the observer is at the behavior (a novice), the greater the impact of the vicarious experience (Schunk, 1989a) Pep talks shift a performer\u2019s attention from sources of inefficacy to sources of efficacy. Its effectiveness is limited by the boundaries of the possible (in the mind of the performer) and depends on the credibility, expertise, and trustworthiness of the persuader. Verbal persuasion works to the extent that it provides the performer with enough of a temporary efficacy boost to generate the motivation necessary for another try (Schunk, 1991). An abnormal physiological state is a private, yet attention getting, message that signals inefficacy. An absence of tension, fear, anxiety, and stress, on the other hand, heightens efficacy by providing firsthand bodily feedback that one can indeed cope adequately with task demands (Bandura &amp; Adams, 1977). Self-efficacy beliefs rise and fall with changes in personal behavior history, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological state. The effect that skilled performance has on self-efficacy is stronger than is the effect that self-efficacy has on skilled performance. Generally speaking, the more people expect that they can adequately perform an action, the more willing they are to put forth effort and persist in facing difficulties (Bandura, 1989; Bandura &amp; Cervone, 1983; Weinberg, Gould, &amp; Jackson, 1979). In contrast, when people expect that they cannot adequately perform the required task, they are not willing to engage in activities requiring such behavior. Instead, they slacken their effort, prematurely settle for mediocre outcomes, and quit in the face of obstacles (Bandura, 1989). More specifically, self-efficacy beliefs affect (1) the choice of activities and selection of environments, (2) the extent of effort and persistence put forth during performance, (3)\n...the quality of thinking and decision making during performance, and (4) emotional reactions, especially those related to stress and anxiety. In general, people seek out and approach with excitement those activities and situations that they feel capable of adjusting to or handling, while people shun and actively avoid those activities and situations that they see as likely to overwhelm their coping capacities (Bandura, 1977, 1989). In a self-efficacy analysis, a person will often choose to avoid tasks and environments as a self-protective act to guard against the possibility of being overwhelmed by demands and challenges. Doubt-plagued avoidance choices exert a profound and detrimental effect on a person\u2019s long-term development (Bandura, 1986). Furthermore, the more they avoid such activities, the more entrenched self-doubt becomes because doubters never get the chance to prove themselves wrong and eliminate opportunities to observe expert models or receive instruction. As people perform, self-efficacy beliefs influence how much effort they exert as well as how long they put forth that effort in the face of adversity (Bandura, 1989). Strong self-efficacy beliefs produce persistent coping efforts aimed at overcoming setbacks and difficulties (Salomon, 1984). Doubt, on the other hand, leads people to slacken their efforts when they encounter difficulties and perhaps give up altogether (Bandura &amp; Cervone, 1983; Weinberg Gould, &amp; Jackson, 1979). Self-doubt also leads performers to settle prematurely on mediocre solutions. Performers with a weak sense of efficacy, however, dwell on personal deficiencies, visualize formidable obstacles, and exude pessimism, anxiety, and depression (Bandura, 1986, 1988). Knowing that one\u2019s coping abilities cannot handle an event\u2019s perceived demands conjures up thoughts of disaster, emotional arousal, and feelings of distress and anxiety (Bandura Reese, &amp; Adams, 1982, 1985; Lazarus, 1991a). Self-efficacy researchers go so far as to say that the root cause of anxiety is low self-efficacy (Bandura, 1983, 1988). Self-efficacy facilitates the type of active task involvement that is needed to increase and improve one\u2019s learning, coping, performing, and achieving\u2014namely, approaching rather than avoiding challenges and opportunities, exerting greater rather than lesser effort, persisting in the face of obstacles rather than giving up, thinking clearly on what needs to be done rather than thinking erratically, negatively, and emotionally, and experiencing constructive emotionality such as hope and interest rather than counterproductive emotionality such as fear and anxiety. People cope with failure in different ways. A mastery motivational orientation refers to a hardy, resistant portrayal of the self during encounters of failure. With a mastery motivational orientation, the person responds to failure by remaining task-oriented and focused on achieving mastery in spite of difficulties and setbacks (Diener &amp; Dweck, 1978, 1980). On the other hand, a helpless motivational orientation refers to a fragile view of the self during encounters of failure. With a helpless motivational orientation, the person responds to failure by giving up and withdrawing, acting as if the situation were out of his or her control (Dweck, 1975; Dweck &amp; Repucci, 1973). When tasks turn difficult and challenging\u2014when outcomes are hard to control, the motivational significance of mastery versus helplessness becomes clear. Mastery-oriented persons seize challenges and become energized by setbacks. Helpless-oriented persons shy away from challenges, fall apart in the face of setbacks, and begin to question and then outright doubt their ability. On those occasions in which success feedback slips into failure feedback, mastery-oriented individuals increase their efforts and change their strategies (Diener &amp; Dweck, 1978, 1980). Under these same conditions, helpless-oriented individuals decrease their efforts and begin to condemn their abilities and lose hope for any future successes (Dweck, 1975; Dweck &amp; Repucci, 1973). In sum, during failure feedback, helpless-oriented people focus on why they are failing (low ability), whereas mastery-oriented people focus on what is to be done to remedy it (effort, strategy; Diener &amp; Dweck, 1978). Mastery-oriented individuals do not see failure as an indictment of the self. Helpless-oriented individuals see failure as an indictment of the self. They see failure as a sign of personal inadequacy, one that in turn leads them toward a state of despair. The self-denigration, negative mood, and immature strategies signal the presence of helplessness, but the telltale sign of helplessness is how quickly and how emphatically the performer gives up (Dweck, 1999). Learned helplessness is the psychological state that results when an individual expects that life\u2019s outcomes are uncontrollable (Mikulincer, 1994; Seligman, 1975). For uncontrollable outcomes, a random relationship exists between behavior and outcomes (e.g., \u201cMy behavior has little effect on what happens to me\u201d). Whenever animals are placed in a situation in which they perceive they have little or no control, they develop the expectation that their future actions will have little or no effect on what happens to them. This learned expectation that one\u2019s voluntary behavior will not affect desired outcomes is the heart of learned helplessness. Humans too learned helplessness. Learned helplessness theory features three components: contingency, cognition, and behavior (Peterson Maier, &amp; Seligman, 1993). Contingency refers to the objective relation between a person\u2019s behavior and the environment\u2019s outcomes. Contingency exists on a continuum that ranges from outcomes that occur on a random basis (i.e., uncontrollable outcomes) to outcomes that occur in perfect synchronization with a person\u2019s voluntary behavior (i.e., controllable outcomes). People\u2019s outcome beliefs (and hence their replies to your question) stem not only from the objective information about the world (i.e., contingency) but also from each person\u2019s unique biases, attributions, and expectancies. Once it occurs, it leaves three reliable deficits in its wake: motivational, learning, and emotional (Alloy &amp; Seligman, 1979). Motivational deficits consist of a decreased willingness to try. Motivational deficits become apparent when a person\u2019s willingness to emit voluntary coping responses decreases or disappears altogether. Typically, when people care about an outcome and when the environment is at least somewhat responsive in delivering those outcomes, they act assertively in bringing about those outcomes. This quote (\u201cWhy try?\u201d) characterizes the motivational deficit in learned helplessness. Learning deficits consist of an acquired pessimistic mindset that interferes with one\u2019s ability to learn new response. Emotional deficits consist of affective disruptions in which lethargic, depressive emotional reactions occur in situations that call for active, assertive emotion. In the face of trauma, the natural and typical response is one of highly mobilized emotion (e.g., fear, anger, assertiveness, frustration). When afraid, people struggle vigorously to overcome, escape, counteract, or do whatever is necessary to cope effectively. Over time, however, an unrelenting onslaught of environmental unresponsiveness leads people to view coping as futile. Once the person becomes convinced that there is nothing that can be done to escape the trauma, the resulting expectation makes energy-mobilizing emotions less likely and makes energy-depleting emotions (e.g., listlessness, apathy, depression) more likely. Some clinical psychologists view learned helplessness as a model of naturally occurring unipolar depression (Rosenhan &amp; Seligman, 1984; Seligman, 1975). The illusion of control is an attributional phenomenon that, over time, fosters an optimistic explanatory style. People with an optimistic explanatory style tend to take substantial credit for their successes but accept little or no blame for their failures. As you might expect, depressed individuals rarely have an optimistic style and do not show an illusion of control (Alloy &amp; Abramson, 1979, 1982). In one sense, an optimistic explanatory style is delusional and associated with a full repertoire of excuses, denials, and self-deceptions (Lazarus, 1983; Sackeim, 1983; Tennen &amp; Affleck, 1987) and narcissism (John &amp; Robins, 1994). Self-efficacy arises from (1) personal behavior history of trying to execute that particular course of action in the past, (2) observations of similar others as they execute the same behavior, (3) verbal persuasions (or pep talks) from others, and (4) physiological states such as an abnormally fast versus calm heartbeat. Once formed, self-efficacy affects the performer\u2019s (1) choice of activities and selection of environments (approach vs. avoidance); (2) extent of effort, persistence, and resiliency; (3) the quality or clarity of one\u2019s thinking and decision making; and (4) emotional reactions, especially those related to stress and anxiety. Learned helplessness is the psychological state that results when an individual expects that events in his or her life are uncontrollable. Helplessness is learned. Three components explain learned helplessness effects: contingency (objective control), cognition (subjective control), and behavior (how actively vs. passively one tries to cope). Once it occurs, helplessness produces profound disruptions in motivation (decreased willingness to try), learning (pessimistic learning set), and emotion (depression replaces energy-mobilizing emotions such as frustration).\n\nXI The Self and Its Strivings\n\nThese six facets of well-being are, in order, self-acceptance\u2014positive evaluations of oneself; positive interpersonal relations\u2014close, warm relationships with others; autonomy\u2014self-determination and personal causation; environmental mastery\u2014sense of effectance in mastering circumstances and challenges; purpose in life\u2014a sense of meaning that gives life direction; and personal growth\u2014harboring a developmental trajectory characterized by improvement and growth (Ryff, 1989, 1995; Ryff &amp; Keyes, 1995; Ryff &amp; Singer, 2002). Self-esteem reflects how life is going, but it is not the source of motivation that allows people to make life go well. Self-concepts are individuals\u2019 mental representations of themselves. The self-concept is constructed from experiences and from reflections on those experiences. During times of reflection, people do not remember the hundreds of individual life experiences. Rather, over time, people translate their multitude of specific experiences into a general representation of the self (e.g., given my inhibited experiences in groups, at the zoo, and during lunch, I perceive myself as \u201cshy\u201d). Self-schemas are cognitive generalizations about the self that are domain specific and learned from past experiences (Markus, 1977, 1983). The earlier generalization of \u201cI\u2019m shy\u201d exemplifies a self-schema. First, self-schemas, once formed, direct an individual\u2019s behavior in ways that elicit feedback consistent with the established self-schemas. That is, because a person sees him- or herself as shy, that person directs his or her future behavior in interpersonal domains in ways that produce feedback that will confirm the \u201cI\u2019m shy\u201d self-view. The basic idea behind self-schema consistency is that if a person is told she is introverted when she believes she is extraverted, that contradictory feedback generates a motivational tension. The tension motivates the self to restore consistency. Therefore, people behave in self-schema-consistent ways to prevent feeling an aversive motivational tension. If prevention does not work, then people behave in ways to generate new additional feedback that will restore self-schema consistency. Second, self-schemas generate motivation to move the present self toward a desired future self. Much like goal setting\u2019s discrepancy-creating process (Chapter 8), an ideal possible self initiates goal-directed behavior. Once an individual establishes a well-articulated self-schema in a particular domain, he generally acts to preserve that self-view. Once established, self-schemas become increasingly resistant to contradictory information (Markus, 1977, 1983). People preserve a consistent self by actively seeking out information consistent with their self-concept and by ignoring information that contradicts their self-view (Swann, 1983, 1985, 1999; Tesser, 1988). It is psychologically disturbing to believe one thing is true about the self yet be told that the reverse is actually the case. Inconsistency and contradiction generate an emotional discomfort that signals that consistency needs to be restored. Furthermore, in the name of self-schema preservation, we intentionally choose to interact with others who treat us in ways that are consistent with our self-view, and we intentionally avoid others who treat us in ways that are inconsistent with our self-view, a process referred to as \u201cselective interaction\u201d (Robinson &amp; Smith-Lovin, 1992; Swann, Pelham, &amp; Krull, 1989). Despite preventive efforts, self-discrepant feedback does sometimes occur (as it did for the career politician and star athlete). The first line of defense is to distort that information. In the face of discrepant self-schema feedback, the individual may ask if the feedback is valid, if the source of the feedback is trustworthy, and how important or relevant this feedback is (Crary, 1966; Markus, 1977; Swann, 1983). People also counter disconfirming feedback with compensatory self-inflation (Greenberg &amp; Pyszczynski, 1985), self-affirmation (Steele, 1988), and a barrage of new behaviors to prove one\u2019s actual self-view (e.g., \u201cNo, no, here let me show you\u2026.\u201d; Swann &amp; Hill, 1982). What all these ways of maintaining self-concept consistency have in common is that they marshal forward counter-examples and counter-explanations to essentially discredit the otherwise self-discrepant feedback. Once invalidated, self-discrepant feedback can be ignored and the self-view preserved. Notice, for instance, that the only path to \u201cSelf-Concept Change\u201d is from low self-concept certainty. Before self-schemas change, (1) self-concept certainty must be low and (2) self-discrepant feedback must be potent and unambiguous\u2014that is, difficult to discredit (Swann, 1983, 1985, 1987). Although self-concept can change, change is the exception rather than the rule. Self-concept change is rare, while self-verification and self-concept consistency are commonplace. Self-schema change can occur through a deliberate effort to advance the present self toward a desired future possible self. Possible selves represent individuals\u2019 ideas of what they would like to become and also what they are afraid they might become (Markus &amp; Nurius, 1986; Markus &amp; Ruvolo, 1989). Possible selves are essentially mental representations of attributes, characteristics, and abilities that the self does not yet possess. Part of the reason why you put forth high effort, persisted, focused attention, and planned strategically in one particular course can be traced to the presence of a relevant and important possible self, just as part of the reason why you slacken effort, persistence, attention, and strategic planning in a second course can be traced to the absence of a relevant and an important possible self. Identity is both a psychological and a sociological phenomenon (Eccles, 2009). Sociologically, identity is one\u2019s place or role in society (Burke, 2003). Psychologically, identity is whether that role or social position or social description \u201cfeels right\u201d and connects well with one\u2019s self-concept or \u201cfeels wrong\u201d in terms of a mismatch between self-concept and social role (Oyserman &amp; Destin, 2011). Identities matter because when a behavior feels identity-congruent, it feels natural and right as it confirms and expresses the identity, just as when a behavior feels unnatural and wrong when it is identity-incongruent (Oyserman, 2007). The questions asked by the self-concordance model (Sheldon, 2002) are (1) How do people decide what to strive for in their lives? and (2) How does this personal striving process sometimes nurture the self and promote well-being yet other times go awry and diminish well-being? A handy \u201cHow am I feeling about this?\u201d self-test exists to determine whether a personal goal is self-concordant or self-discordant. Self-concordant goals (intrinsic goals, identified goals) emanate out of a sense of authenticity and personal ownership (e.g., \u201cI want to quit smoking\u201d). On the other hand, self-discordant goals (extrinsic goals, introjected goals) emanate out of a sense of conflict, pressure, and obligation to others or to social demands (e.g., \u201cI have to quit smoking\u201d) (Sheldon &amp; Elliot, 1999; Sheldon &amp; Houser-Marko, 2001). The act of acquiring a heartfelt sense of ownership in one\u2019s personal goals is a crucial developmental task of the self. \n\nIntrinsic goals are those life aspirations and pursuits that are inherently satisfying because their pursuit gives rise to frequent and recurring opportunities for the goal striver to experience autonomy, competence, and relatedness need satisfaction along the way. Extrinsic goals are those life aspirations and pursuits that require contingent regard or affirmation from others and are therefore neutral or unsatisfying. Rather than create opportunities for psychological need satisfaction, what people who pursue extrinsic goals experience along the way tends to be (1) less loving and more conflicted relationships (Kasser &amp; Ryan, 2001); (2) social comparisons (e.g., \u201cAm I wealthier, more attractive, and more popular than her?\u201d; Ryan, Kuhl, &amp; Deci, 1997); and (3) little time left over to devote to pursuing need-satisfying intrinsic goals (Frey &amp; Oberholzer-Gee, 1997). Overall, extrinsic goal pursuit reflects a materialistic value system that places a strong emphasis on the acquisition of money, fame, and image as a pathway to happiness and well-being (Kasser, 2002, 2016; Kasser &amp; Kanner, 2004). Furthermore, it is a key point that even when those who pursue extrinsic goals actually attain their goals (i.e., become millionaires, celebrities), they still do not experience psychological well-being (Kasser &amp; Ryan, 2001). Subjective well-being does not come from attaining one\u2019s goals; instead, it comes from why one is striving for whatever it is one is striving for (Emmons, 1996; Sheldon &amp; Elliot, 1998). When people strive for autonomy, competence, and relatedness aspirations, they are able to create a meaning in their lives that fosters subjective well-being. This process of exerting and managing the self to accomplish a long-term goal is referred to as self-regulation. Goal striving requires cognitive, motivational, and emotional work, because plans and strategies need to be implemented, while self-control requires suppressing and overriding short-term goal-antagonistic impulses, distractions, and temptations. Self-regulation is an ongoing, cyclical process. That self-regulation is an acquired skill is most apparent when people pursue a long-term goal in an unfamiliar domain. Self-regulation involves the capacity to carry out the full goal-setting process on one\u2019s own (Schunk &amp; Zimmerman, 1997). Long-term goal pursuit is difficult for many reasons, one of which is that people are more attracted to the immediate gratification of short-term temptations than they are to the delayed gratification from long-term goals. Impulsive behavior is quick and easy. Self-control is the capacity to suppress, restrain, and even override an impulsive desire so to pursue a long-term goal (Bauer &amp; Baumeister, 2011). It is the capacity to interrupt our tendency toward automatic pilot and short-term attractions and, instead, to steer behavior intentionally in the direction of a long-term goal. At a colloquial level, self-control is \u201cwillpower\u201d (Baumeister &amp; Tierney, 2011). Seven broad spheres of self-control: \u00b7 Suppressing impulses, urges, desires \u00b7 Managing and suppressing emotions \u00b7 Controlling and suppressing thoughts \u00b7 Controlling attention \u00b7 Making decisions and lots of choices \u00b7 Managing the impression one is making on others \u00b7 Being kind when dealing with difficult, demanding people. The findings from the radish experiment suggest that self-control is more than a skill. It is an energy reserve that exists in only a limited amount. After self-control is exercised, people temporarily lose some of their capacity for future self-control. 1. Amount or strength of willpower is critical to the success of self-control. 2. The exertion of self-control depletes some of this resource, and hence, 3. Subsequent attempts at self-control are increasingly likely to fail. Such a model begs the question as to what is depleted during self-control attempts. The answer seems to be the brain fuel of glucose (Gailliot &amp; Baumeister, 2007; Gailliot et al., 2007). Glucose is manufactured in the body from food. During digestion, this sugar is produced and released into the bloodstream where it travels to the muscles, heart, liver, immune system, and brain. The brain is a big user of energy; it consumes about 20 percent of the body\u2019s glucose-supplied fuel (i.e., calories). Glucose does not actually enter the brain but, instead, it is converted into what the brain does use\u2014namely, neurotransmitters. If the brain runs out of neurotransmitters, then it stops thinking. And if the brain stops thinking, it becomes more impulsive and exerts less executive control. All this complex biology boils down to a simple understanding: \u201cNo glucose, no willpower\u201d (Baumeister &amp; Tierney, 2011, p. 49). If the aforementioned reasoning is sound, then people who exert self-control should show a significant drop in their glucose level. Research shows that this is precisely what does happen and, further, that the drop in glucose is rather quick and rather large (Gailliot &amp; Baumeister, 2007; Gailliot et al., 2007). That is, if you possess glucose level \u201cX\u201d and then engage in a self-control task such as suppressing an urge, then you will rather quickly have glucose level \u201cless than X.\u201d Knowing this, people can consume glucose in advance of a challenging self-control task by drinking a glass of glucose-rich orange juice, lemonade, or a milkshake. Doing so does significantly help people exert effective self-control (Hagger Wood, Stiff, &amp; Chatzisarantis, 2010). Glucose does not have to be consumed via a sugary drink, but this is the fastest way to get glucose to the brain (as a diabetic will tell you). Low-sugar, high-protein foods (nuts, fruits, fish, meat, cheese) work just as well, but they take longer to produce brain fuel. Such a nutritional effect leads self-control researchers to the practical advice that you eat a good breakfast before embarking on any day that will require a fair amount of self-control. Self-control depletes glucose, but it does so only when self-control means suppressing an attractive short-term urge (eat sweets, smoke a cigarette, play video games) in order to pursue a less inherently attractive long-term goal (study for hours, complete a long list of chores, control one\u2019s temper during a negotiation). Interestingly, glucose depletion and poor performance do not occur if the person is first placed in a positive mood state, as by watching and laughing with a humorous film (Tice, Baumeister, Shmueli, &amp; Muraven, 2007). Glucose depletion and poor performance also do not occur when people pursue long-term goals that satisfy the psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness (Muraven, 2008). In fact, long-term goal pursuit that produces episodes of psychological need satisfaction actually vitalizes (increases) energy and performance, rather than depletes them (Moller, Deci, &amp; Ryan, 2006; Muraven, Gagne, &amp; Rosman, 2008). Self-control strength can also be enhanced through practice (Baumeister, Gailliot, De Wall, &amp; Oaten, 2006). After two weeks of self-control practice, trained participants showed less depletion than did a control group of untrained participants (see also Oaten &amp; Cheng, 2006). \n\nXII Nature of Emotion: Six Perennial Questions\n\nRichard Lazarus was a pioneer in the cognitive perspective to understanding emotion, and his basic argument was that without an understanding of the personal relevance of an event\u2019s potential impact on personal well-being, there is no reason to respond emotionally. The quality of people\u2019s emotion regulation skill predicts the quality of their functioning in various domains, such as having high-quality peer relationships (Lopes, Salovey, Cote, &amp; Beers, 2005), high-quality relationships with teachers (Grazziano, Reavis, Keane &amp; Calkins, 2007), and strong academic achievement (Gumora &amp; Arsenio, 2002). Emotions are often automatic reactions, but there are nevertheless numerous opportunities within the flow of an emotional episode to intervene to change the course it takes. Emotion regulation refers to how we try to influence which emotions we have, when we have them, and how we experience and express the emotions we have. Five emotion regulation strategies are common. Situation selection is taking action to approach or avoid a known emotion-eliciting situation. Situation modification is altering the emotion-eliciting situation so that it becomes more likely to produce positive emotions and less likely to produce negative emotions. Attentional focus includes effective strategies such as distraction, drawing, and savoring, but also ineffective ones such as rumination. Reappraisal refers to changing how one appraises the meaning emotion-eliciting event, as a threatening job interview can be reinterpreted as a beneficial opportunity. Suppression is a strategy to down regulate a negative emotion or one of its components. Overall, emotion regulation is a skill that predicts people\u2019s functioning in terms of interpersonal relationships and personal productivity.\n\nXIII Aspects of Emotion\n\nThe central construct in a cognitive understanding of emotion is appraisal (Moors, Ellsworth, Scherer, &amp; Frijda, 2013). Appraisal is a cognitive process that evaluates the significance of environmental events in terms of one\u2019s well-being (e.g., \u201cIs this situation significant to me?\u201d). Well-being is driven by the individual\u2019s goals, needs, values, beliefs, and attachments or personal relationships. Appraisals change over time. 1. Without an antecedent cognitive appraisal of the event, emotions do not occur. 2. The appraisal, not the event itself, causes the emotion. 3. Emotion is a process. 4. If the appraisal changes, even if the situation does not, then the emotion will change. According to Arnold, people categorically appraise stimulus events and objects as positive or negative. This good/bad appraisal was simply a gut-felt evaluation of the stimulus event. Recent neuroanatomical research confirms Arnold\u2019s claim that the subcortical brain (and amygdala in particular) is the focal brain center that appraises the emotional significance of sensory stimuli (Berridge &amp; Kringelbach, 2008; LeDoux, 2012). In addition, most stimuli are further appraised cortically by adding information processing and hence expectations, memories, beliefs, goals, judgments, and attributions (Davidson &amp; Irwin, 1999; Ochsner &amp; Gross, 2005). Full appraisal therefore draws on both automatic subcortical and reflective cortical evaluations of the stimulus event in terms of sensory information and in terms of the person\u2019s goals and preferences. Once an object has been appraised as good or bad (as beneficial or harmful), an experience of liking or disliking follows immediately and automatically. The motivational reflex model states that any stimulus is automatically categorized as either good or bad, which, in turn, activates the corresponding approach or avoidance motivational system, which, in turn, almost reflexively (automatically) prepares the person to approach the potential benefit or to avoid the potential threat (Eder, Elliot, &amp; Harmon-Jones, 2013).", "author_fullname": "t2_qtdyp5pg", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "I read a 500 page textbook on MOTIVATION so you don't have to.

Expectancy is a subjective prediction of how likely it is that an event will occur. Two types of expectancies exist: efficacy and outcome (Bandura, 1977, 1986, 1997; Heckhausen, 1977; Peterson Maier, &amp;amp; Seligman 1993). An efficacy expectation (see Figure 10.1) is a judgment of one\u2019s capacity to execute a particular act or course of action. The question is, \u201cCan I do it?\u201d An outcome expectation (see Figure 10.1) is a judgment that a given action, once performed, will cause a particular outcome. The question is, \u201cWill it work?\u201d Take away either of these positive forecasts, and reluctance and avoidance become rather logical ways of acting. While \u201cpersonal control beliefs\u201d is a wide-ranging topic, much of its essence can be seen in how we cope with failure. To function competently when failure comes our way, we need to be not disrupted by it but instead use what it is telling us so that we can enhance our progress in whatever it is we are trying to do. Most importantly, we can appraise (interpret) a failure episode as either a challenge or a threat (Skinner &amp;amp; Wellborn, 1997). Failure as challenge means we understand the meaning of failure as an opportunity for growth and learning. Thinking this way, we tend to cope in mastery-oriented ways, and this empowering coping style leads to adaptive functioning and outcomes. Failure as threat means we understand the meaning of failure as a danger to our well-being\u2014something is wrong with us that has caused the failure to happen. Thinking this way, we tend to cope in defensive, self-protective ways, and this debilitating coping style leads to maladaptive functioning and outcomes. Competent functioning requires not only possessing skills (i.e., ability), but also the capacity to translate those skills into effective performance, especially under trying and difficult circumstances. Self-efficacy is just as important a determinant of competent functioning as is ability because performance situations often are stressful, ambiguous, and unpredictable, and as one performs, circumstances always change (Bandura, 1997). The opposite of efficacy is doubt. Extent of self-efficacy (vs. self-doubt) is the motivational variable that determines the extent to which a performer copes well (vs. poorly) when her skills and abilities are stressed. The extent to which a person believes she can competently enact a particular course of action stems from her personal history of trying to enact that course of action in the past (Bandura, 1986, 1997; Bandura, Reese, &amp;amp; Adams, 1982). People learn their current self-efficacy from their interpretations and memories of past attempts to execute the same behavior. Memories and recollections judged as competent raise self-efficacy, whereas memories and recollections judged as incompetent lower self-efficacy. Competent enactment will not raise a strong sense of inefficacy much). If the performer is less experienced (i.e., lacks a behavioral history), however, each new competent or incompetent enactment will rather substantially inform future efficacy. Of the four sources of self- efficacy, personal behavior history is the most influential (Bandura, 1986). Seeing others perform masterfully raises the observer\u2019s own sense of efficacy (Bandura, Adams, Hardy, &amp;amp; Howells, 1980; Kazdin, 1979). But vicarious experience works the other way as well, because observing others perform the same behavior clumsily lowers our own sense of efficacy. First, the greater the similarity between the model and the observer, the greater the impact the model\u2019s behavior will have on the observer\u2019s own efficacy forecast (Schunk, 1989b). Second, the less experienced the observer is at the behavior (a novice), the greater the impact of the vicarious experience (Schunk, 1989a) Pep talks shift a performer\u2019s attention from sources of inefficacy to sources of efficacy. Its effectiveness is limited by the boundaries of the possible (in the mind of the performer) and depends on the credibility, expertise, and trustworthiness of the persuader. Verbal persuasion works to the extent that it provides the performer with enough of a temporary efficacy boost to generate the motivation necessary for another try (Schunk, 1991). An abnormal physiological state is a private, yet attention getting, message that signals inefficacy. An absence of tension, fear, anxiety, and stress, on the other hand, heightens efficacy by providing firsthand bodily feedback that one can indeed cope adequately with task demands (Bandura &amp;amp; Adams, 1977). Self-efficacy beliefs rise and fall with changes in personal behavior history, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological state. The effect that skilled performance has on self-efficacy is stronger than is the effect that self-efficacy has on skilled performance. Generally speaking, the more people expect that they can adequately perform an action, the more willing they are to put forth effort and persist in facing difficulties (Bandura, 1989; Bandura &amp;amp; Cervone, 1983; Weinberg, Gould, &amp;amp; Jackson, 1979). In contrast, when people expect that they cannot adequately perform the required task, they are not willing to engage in activities requiring such behavior. Instead, they slacken their effort, prematurely settle for mediocre outcomes, and quit in the face of obstacles (Bandura, 1989). More specifically, self-efficacy beliefs affect (1) the choice of activities and selection of environments, (2) the extent of effort and persistence put forth during performance, (3)\n...the quality of thinking and decision making during performance, and (4) emotional reactions, especially those related to stress and anxiety. In general, people seek out and approach with excitement those activities and situations that they feel capable of adjusting to or handling, while people shun and actively avoid those activities and situations that they see as likely to overwhelm their coping capacities (Bandura, 1977, 1989). In a self-efficacy analysis, a person will often choose to avoid tasks and environments as a self-protective act to guard against the possibility of being overwhelmed by demands and challenges. Doubt-plagued avoidance choices exert a profound and detrimental effect on a person\u2019s long-term development (Bandura, 1986). Furthermore, the more they avoid such activities, the more entrenched self-doubt becomes because doubters never get the chance to prove themselves wrong and eliminate opportunities to observe expert models or receive instruction. As people perform, self-efficacy beliefs influence how much effort they exert as well as how long they put forth that effort in the face of adversity (Bandura, 1989). Strong self-efficacy beliefs produce persistent coping efforts aimed at overcoming setbacks and difficulties (Salomon, 1984). Doubt, on the other hand, leads people to slacken their efforts when they encounter difficulties and perhaps give up altogether (Bandura &amp;amp; Cervone, 1983; Weinberg Gould, &amp;amp; Jackson, 1979). Self-doubt also leads performers to settle prematurely on mediocre solutions. Performers with a weak sense of efficacy, however, dwell on personal deficiencies, visualize formidable obstacles, and exude pessimism, anxiety, and depression (Bandura, 1986, 1988). Knowing that one\u2019s coping abilities cannot handle an event\u2019s perceived demands conjures up thoughts of disaster, emotional arousal, and feelings of distress and anxiety (Bandura Reese, &amp;amp; Adams, 1982, 1985; Lazarus, 1991a). Self-efficacy researchers go so far as to say that the root cause of anxiety is low self-efficacy (Bandura, 1983, 1988). Self-efficacy facilitates the type of active task involvement that is needed to increase and improve one\u2019s learning, coping, performing, and achieving\u2014namely, approaching rather than avoiding challenges and opportunities, exerting greater rather than lesser effort, persisting in the face of obstacles rather than giving up, thinking clearly on what needs to be done rather than thinking erratically, negatively, and emotionally, and experiencing constructive emotionality such as hope and interest rather than counterproductive emotionality such as fear and anxiety. People cope with failure in different ways. A mastery motivational orientation refers to a hardy, resistant portrayal of the self during encounters of failure. With a mastery motivational orientation, the person responds to failure by remaining task-oriented and focused on achieving mastery in spite of difficulties and setbacks (Diener &amp;amp; Dweck, 1978, 1980). On the other hand, a helpless motivational orientation refers to a fragile view of the self during encounters of failure. With a helpless motivational orientation, the person responds to failure by giving up and withdrawing, acting as if the situation were out of his or her control (Dweck, 1975; Dweck &amp;amp; Repucci, 1973). When tasks turn difficult and challenging\u2014when outcomes are hard to control, the motivational significance of mastery versus helplessness becomes clear. Mastery-oriented persons seize challenges and become energized by setbacks. Helpless-oriented persons shy away from challenges, fall apart in the face of setbacks, and begin to question and then outright doubt their ability. On those occasions in which success feedback slips into failure feedback, mastery-oriented individuals increase their efforts and change their strategies (Diener &amp;amp; Dweck, 1978, 1980). Under these same conditions, helpless-oriented individuals decrease their efforts and begin to condemn their abilities and lose hope for any future successes (Dweck, 1975; Dweck &amp;amp; Repucci, 1973). In sum, during failure feedback, helpless-oriented people focus on why they are failing (low ability), whereas mastery-oriented people focus on what is to be done to remedy it (effort, strategy; Diener &amp;amp; Dweck, 1978). Mastery-oriented individuals do not see failure as an indictment of the self. Helpless-oriented individuals see failure as an indictment of the self. They see failure as a sign of personal inadequacy, one that in turn leads them toward a state of despair. The self-denigration, negative mood, and immature strategies signal the presence of helplessness, but the telltale sign of helplessness is how quickly and how emphatically the performer gives up (Dweck, 1999). Learned helplessness is the psychological state that results when an individual expects that life\u2019s outcomes are uncontrollable (Mikulincer, 1994; Seligman, 1975). For uncontrollable outcomes, a random relationship exists between behavior and outcomes (e.g., \u201cMy behavior has little effect on what happens to me\u201d). Whenever animals are placed in a situation in which they perceive they have little or no control, they develop the expectation that their future actions will have little or no effect on what happens to them. This learned expectation that one\u2019s voluntary behavior will not affect desired outcomes is the heart of learned helplessness. Humans too learned helplessness. Learned helplessness theory features three components: contingency, cognition, and behavior (Peterson Maier, &amp;amp; Seligman, 1993). Contingency refers to the objective relation between a person\u2019s behavior and the environment\u2019s outcomes. Contingency exists on a continuum that ranges from outcomes that occur on a random basis (i.e., uncontrollable outcomes) to outcomes that occur in perfect synchronization with a person\u2019s voluntary behavior (i.e., controllable outcomes). People\u2019s outcome beliefs (and hence their replies to your question) stem not only from the objective information about the world (i.e., contingency) but also from each person\u2019s unique biases, attributions, and expectancies. Once it occurs, it leaves three reliable deficits in its wake: motivational, learning, and emotional (Alloy &amp;amp; Seligman, 1979). Motivational deficits consist of a decreased willingness to try. Motivational deficits become apparent when a person\u2019s willingness to emit voluntary coping responses decreases or disappears altogether. Typically, when people care about an outcome and when the environment is at least somewhat responsive in delivering those outcomes, they act assertively in bringing about those outcomes. This quote (\u201cWhy try?\u201d) characterizes the motivational deficit in learned helplessness. Learning deficits consist of an acquired pessimistic mindset that interferes with one\u2019s ability to learn new response. Emotional deficits consist of affective disruptions in which lethargic, depressive emotional reactions occur in situations that call for active, assertive emotion. In the face of trauma, the natural and typical response is one of highly mobilized emotion (e.g., fear, anger, assertiveness, frustration). When afraid, people struggle vigorously to overcome, escape, counteract, or do whatever is necessary to cope effectively. Over time, however, an unrelenting onslaught of environmental unresponsiveness leads people to view coping as futile. Once the person becomes convinced that there is nothing that can be done to escape the trauma, the resulting expectation makes energy-mobilizing emotions less likely and makes energy-depleting emotions (e.g., listlessness, apathy, depression) more likely. Some clinical psychologists view learned helplessness as a model of naturally occurring unipolar depression (Rosenhan &amp;amp; Seligman, 1984; Seligman, 1975). The illusion of control is an attributional phenomenon that, over time, fosters an optimistic explanatory style. People with an optimistic explanatory style tend to take substantial credit for their successes but accept little or no blame for their failures. As you might expect, depressed individuals rarely have an optimistic style and do not show an illusion of control (Alloy &amp;amp; Abramson, 1979, 1982). In one sense, an optimistic explanatory style is delusional and associated with a full repertoire of excuses, denials, and self-deceptions (Lazarus, 1983; Sackeim, 1983; Tennen &amp;amp; Affleck, 1987) and narcissism (John &amp;amp; Robins, 1994). Self-efficacy arises from (1) personal behavior history of trying to execute that particular course of action in the past, (2) observations of similar others as they execute the same behavior, (3) verbal persuasions (or pep talks) from others, and (4) physiological states such as an abnormally fast versus calm heartbeat. Once formed, self-efficacy affects the performer\u2019s (1) choice of activities and selection of environments (approach vs. avoidance); (2) extent of effort, persistence, and resiliency; (3) the quality or clarity of one\u2019s thinking and decision making; and (4) emotional reactions, especially those related to stress and anxiety. Learned helplessness is the psychological state that results when an individual expects that events in his or her life are uncontrollable. Helplessness is learned. Three components explain learned helplessness effects: contingency (objective control), cognition (subjective control), and behavior (how actively vs. passively one tries to cope). Once it occurs, helplessness produces profound disruptions in motivation (decreased willingness to try), learning (pessimistic learning set), and emotion (depression replaces energy-mobilizing emotions such as frustration).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;XI The Self and Its Strivings&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These six facets of well-being are, in order, self-acceptance\u2014positive evaluations of oneself; positive interpersonal relations\u2014close, warm relationships with others; autonomy\u2014self-determination and personal causation; environmental mastery\u2014sense of effectance in mastering circumstances and challenges; purpose in life\u2014a sense of meaning that gives life direction; and personal growth\u2014harboring a developmental trajectory characterized by improvement and growth (Ryff, 1989, 1995; Ryff &amp;amp; Keyes, 1995; Ryff &amp;amp; Singer, 2002). Self-esteem reflects how life is going, but it is not the source of motivation that allows people to make life go well. Self-concepts are individuals\u2019 mental representations of themselves. The self-concept is constructed from experiences and from reflections on those experiences. During times of reflection, people do not remember the hundreds of individual life experiences. Rather, over time, people translate their multitude of specific experiences into a general representation of the self (e.g., given my inhibited experiences in groups, at the zoo, and during lunch, I perceive myself as \u201cshy\u201d). Self-schemas are cognitive generalizations about the self that are domain specific and learned from past experiences (Markus, 1977, 1983). The earlier generalization of \u201cI\u2019m shy\u201d exemplifies a self-schema. First, self-schemas, once formed, direct an individual\u2019s behavior in ways that elicit feedback consistent with the established self-schemas. That is, because a person sees him- or herself as shy, that person directs his or her future behavior in interpersonal domains in ways that produce feedback that will confirm the \u201cI\u2019m shy\u201d self-view. The basic idea behind self-schema consistency is that if a person is told she is introverted when she believes she is extraverted, that contradictory feedback generates a motivational tension. The tension motivates the self to restore consistency. Therefore, people behave in self-schema-consistent ways to prevent feeling an aversive motivational tension. If prevention does not work, then people behave in ways to generate new additional feedback that will restore self-schema consistency. Second, self-schemas generate motivation to move the present self toward a desired future self. Much like goal setting\u2019s discrepancy-creating process (Chapter 8), an ideal possible self initiates goal-directed behavior. Once an individual establishes a well-articulated self-schema in a particular domain, he generally acts to preserve that self-view. Once established, self-schemas become increasingly resistant to contradictory information (Markus, 1977, 1983). People preserve a consistent self by actively seeking out information consistent with their self-concept and by ignoring information that contradicts their self-view (Swann, 1983, 1985, 1999; Tesser, 1988). It is psychologically disturbing to believe one thing is true about the self yet be told that the reverse is actually the case. Inconsistency and contradiction generate an emotional discomfort that signals that consistency needs to be restored. Furthermore, in the name of self-schema preservation, we intentionally choose to interact with others who treat us in ways that are consistent with our self-view, and we intentionally avoid others who treat us in ways that are inconsistent with our self-view, a process referred to as \u201cselective interaction\u201d (Robinson &amp;amp; Smith-Lovin, 1992; Swann, Pelham, &amp;amp; Krull, 1989). Despite preventive efforts, self-discrepant feedback does sometimes occur (as it did for the career politician and star athlete). The first line of defense is to distort that information. In the face of discrepant self-schema feedback, the individual may ask if the feedback is valid, if the source of the feedback is trustworthy, and how important or relevant this feedback is (Crary, 1966; Markus, 1977; Swann, 1983). People also counter disconfirming feedback with compensatory self-inflation (Greenberg &amp;amp; Pyszczynski, 1985), self-affirmation (Steele, 1988), and a barrage of new behaviors to prove one\u2019s actual self-view (e.g., \u201cNo, no, here let me show you\u2026.\u201d; Swann &amp;amp; Hill, 1982). What all these ways of maintaining self-concept consistency have in common is that they marshal forward counter-examples and counter-explanations to essentially discredit the otherwise self-discrepant feedback. Once invalidated, self-discrepant feedback can be ignored and the self-view preserved. Notice, for instance, that the only path to \u201cSelf-Concept Change\u201d is from low self-concept certainty. Before self-schemas change, (1) self-concept certainty must be low and (2) self-discrepant feedback must be potent and unambiguous\u2014that is, difficult to discredit (Swann, 1983, 1985, 1987). Although self-concept can change, change is the exception rather than the rule. Self-concept change is rare, while self-verification and self-concept consistency are commonplace. Self-schema change can occur through a deliberate effort to advance the present self toward a desired future possible self. Possible selves represent individuals\u2019 ideas of what they would like to become and also what they are afraid they might become (Markus &amp;amp; Nurius, 1986; Markus &amp;amp; Ruvolo, 1989). Possible selves are essentially mental representations of attributes, characteristics, and abilities that the self does not yet possess. Part of the reason why you put forth high effort, persisted, focused attention, and planned strategically in one particular course can be traced to the presence of a relevant and important possible self, just as part of the reason why you slacken effort, persistence, attention, and strategic planning in a second course can be traced to the absence of a relevant and an important possible self. Identity is both a psychological and a sociological phenomenon (Eccles, 2009). Sociologically, identity is one\u2019s place or role in society (Burke, 2003). Psychologically, identity is whether that role or social position or social description \u201cfeels right\u201d and connects well with one\u2019s self-concept or \u201cfeels wrong\u201d in terms of a mismatch between self-concept and social role (Oyserman &amp;amp; Destin, 2011). Identities matter because when a behavior feels identity-congruent, it feels natural and right as it confirms and expresses the identity, just as when a behavior feels unnatural and wrong when it is identity-incongruent (Oyserman, 2007). The questions asked by the self-concordance model (Sheldon, 2002) are (1) How do people decide what to strive for in their lives? and (2) How does this personal striving process sometimes nurture the self and promote well-being yet other times go awry and diminish well-being? A handy \u201cHow am I feeling about this?\u201d self-test exists to determine whether a personal goal is self-concordant or self-discordant. Self-concordant goals (intrinsic goals, identified goals) emanate out of a sense of authenticity and personal ownership (e.g., \u201cI want to quit smoking\u201d). On the other hand, self-discordant goals (extrinsic goals, introjected goals) emanate out of a sense of conflict, pressure, and obligation to others or to social demands (e.g., \u201cI have to quit smoking\u201d) (Sheldon &amp;amp; Elliot, 1999; Sheldon &amp;amp; Houser-Marko, 2001). The act of acquiring a heartfelt sense of ownership in one\u2019s personal goals is a crucial developmental task of the self. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intrinsic goals are those life aspirations and pursuits that are inherently satisfying because their pursuit gives rise to frequent and recurring opportunities for the goal striver to experience autonomy, competence, and relatedness need satisfaction along the way. Extrinsic goals are those life aspirations and pursuits that require contingent regard or affirmation from others and are therefore neutral or unsatisfying. Rather than create opportunities for psychological need satisfaction, what people who pursue extrinsic goals experience along the way tends to be (1) less loving and more conflicted relationships (Kasser &amp;amp; Ryan, 2001); (2) social comparisons (e.g., \u201cAm I wealthier, more attractive, and more popular than her?\u201d; Ryan, Kuhl, &amp;amp; Deci, 1997); and (3) little time left over to devote to pursuing need-satisfying intrinsic goals (Frey &amp;amp; Oberholzer-Gee, 1997). Overall, extrinsic goal pursuit reflects a materialistic value system that places a strong emphasis on the acquisition of money, fame, and image as a pathway to happiness and well-being (Kasser, 2002, 2016; Kasser &amp;amp; Kanner, 2004). Furthermore, it is a key point that even when those who pursue extrinsic goals actually attain their goals (i.e., become millionaires, celebrities), they still do not experience psychological well-being (Kasser &amp;amp; Ryan, 2001). Subjective well-being does not come from attaining one\u2019s goals; instead, it comes from why one is striving for whatever it is one is striving for (Emmons, 1996; Sheldon &amp;amp; Elliot, 1998). When people strive for autonomy, competence, and relatedness aspirations, they are able to create a meaning in their lives that fosters subjective well-being. This process of exerting and managing the self to accomplish a long-term goal is referred to as self-regulation. Goal striving requires cognitive, motivational, and emotional work, because plans and strategies need to be implemented, while self-control requires suppressing and overriding short-term goal-antagonistic impulses, distractions, and temptations. Self-regulation is an ongoing, cyclical process. That self-regulation is an acquired skill is most apparent when people pursue a long-term goal in an unfamiliar domain. Self-regulation involves the capacity to carry out the full goal-setting process on one\u2019s own (Schunk &amp;amp; Zimmerman, 1997). Long-term goal pursuit is difficult for many reasons, one of which is that people are more attracted to the immediate gratification of short-term temptations than they are to the delayed gratification from long-term goals. Impulsive behavior is quick and easy. Self-control is the capacity to suppress, restrain, and even override an impulsive desire so to pursue a long-term goal (Bauer &amp;amp; Baumeister, 2011). It is the capacity to interrupt our tendency toward automatic pilot and short-term attractions and, instead, to steer behavior intentionally in the direction of a long-term goal. At a colloquial level, self-control is \u201cwillpower\u201d (Baumeister &amp;amp; Tierney, 2011). Seven broad spheres of self-control: \u00b7 Suppressing impulses, urges, desires \u00b7 Managing and suppressing emotions \u00b7 Controlling and suppressing thoughts \u00b7 Controlling attention \u00b7 Making decisions and lots of choices \u00b7 Managing the impression one is making on others \u00b7 Being kind when dealing with difficult, demanding people. The findings from the radish experiment suggest that self-control is more than a skill. It is an energy reserve that exists in only a limited amount. After self-control is exercised, people temporarily lose some of their capacity for future self-control. 1. Amount or strength of willpower is critical to the success of self-control. 2. The exertion of self-control depletes some of this resource, and hence, 3. Subsequent attempts at self-control are increasingly likely to fail. Such a model begs the question as to what is depleted during self-control attempts. The answer seems to be the brain fuel of glucose (Gailliot &amp;amp; Baumeister, 2007; Gailliot et al., 2007). Glucose is manufactured in the body from food. During digestion, this sugar is produced and released into the bloodstream where it travels to the muscles, heart, liver, immune system, and brain. The brain is a big user of energy; it consumes about 20 percent of the body\u2019s glucose-supplied fuel (i.e., calories). Glucose does not actually enter the brain but, instead, it is converted into what the brain does use\u2014namely, neurotransmitters. If the brain runs out of neurotransmitters, then it stops thinking. And if the brain stops thinking, it becomes more impulsive and exerts less executive control. All this complex biology boils down to a simple understanding: \u201cNo glucose, no willpower\u201d (Baumeister &amp;amp; Tierney, 2011, p. 49). If the aforementioned reasoning is sound, then people who exert self-control should show a significant drop in their glucose level. Research shows that this is precisely what does happen and, further, that the drop in glucose is rather quick and rather large (Gailliot &amp;amp; Baumeister, 2007; Gailliot et al., 2007). That is, if you possess glucose level \u201cX\u201d and then engage in a self-control task such as suppressing an urge, then you will rather quickly have glucose level \u201cless than X.\u201d Knowing this, people can consume glucose in advance of a challenging self-control task by drinking a glass of glucose-rich orange juice, lemonade, or a milkshake. Doing so does significantly help people exert effective self-control (Hagger Wood, Stiff, &amp;amp; Chatzisarantis, 2010). Glucose does not have to be consumed via a sugary drink, but this is the fastest way to get glucose to the brain (as a diabetic will tell you). Low-sugar, high-protein foods (nuts, fruits, fish, meat, cheese) work just as well, but they take longer to produce brain fuel. Such a nutritional effect leads self-control researchers to the practical advice that you eat a good breakfast before embarking on any day that will require a fair amount of self-control. Self-control depletes glucose, but it does so only when self-control means suppressing an attractive short-term urge (eat sweets, smoke a cigarette, play video games) in order to pursue a less inherently attractive long-term goal (study for hours, complete a long list of chores, control one\u2019s temper during a negotiation). Interestingly, glucose depletion and poor performance do not occur if the person is first placed in a positive mood state, as by watching and laughing with a humorous film (Tice, Baumeister, Shmueli, &amp;amp; Muraven, 2007). Glucose depletion and poor performance also do not occur when people pursue long-term goals that satisfy the psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness (Muraven, 2008). In fact, long-term goal pursuit that produces episodes of psychological need satisfaction actually vitalizes (increases) energy and performance, rather than depletes them (Moller, Deci, &amp;amp; Ryan, 2006; Muraven, Gagne, &amp;amp; Rosman, 2008). Self-control strength can also be enhanced through practice (Baumeister, Gailliot, De Wall, &amp;amp; Oaten, 2006). After two weeks of self-control practice, trained participants showed less depletion than did a control group of untrained participants (see also Oaten &amp;amp; Cheng, 2006). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;XII Nature of Emotion: Six Perennial Questions&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Richard Lazarus was a pioneer in the cognitive perspective to understanding emotion, and his basic argument was that without an understanding of the personal relevance of an event\u2019s potential impact on personal well-being, there is no reason to respond emotionally. The quality of people\u2019s emotion regulation skill predicts the quality of their functioning in various domains, such as having high-quality peer relationships (Lopes, Salovey, Cote, &amp;amp; Beers, 2005), high-quality relationships with teachers (Grazziano, Reavis, Keane &amp;amp; Calkins, 2007), and strong academic achievement (Gumora &amp;amp; Arsenio, 2002). Emotions are often automatic reactions, but there are nevertheless numerous opportunities within the flow of an emotional episode to intervene to change the course it takes. Emotion regulation refers to how we try to influence which emotions we have, when we have them, and how we experience and express the emotions we have. Five emotion regulation strategies are common. Situation selection is taking action to approach or avoid a known emotion-eliciting situation. Situation modification is altering the emotion-eliciting situation so that it becomes more likely to produce positive emotions and less likely to produce negative emotions. Attentional focus includes effective strategies such as distraction, drawing, and savoring, but also ineffective ones such as rumination. Reappraisal refers to changing how one appraises the meaning emotion-eliciting event, as a threatening job interview can be reinterpreted as a beneficial opportunity. Suppression is a strategy to down regulate a negative emotion or one of its components. Overall, emotion regulation is a skill that predicts people\u2019s functioning in terms of interpersonal relationships and personal productivity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;XIII Aspects of Emotion&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The central construct in a cognitive understanding of emotion is appraisal (Moors, Ellsworth, Scherer, &amp;amp; Frijda, 2013). Appraisal is a cognitive process that evaluates the significance of environmental events in terms of one\u2019s well-being (e.g., \u201cIs this situation significant to me?\u201d). Well-being is driven by the individual\u2019s goals, needs, values, beliefs, and attachments or personal relationships. Appraisals change over time. 1. Without an antecedent cognitive appraisal of the event, emotions do not occur. 2. The appraisal, not the event itself, causes the emotion. 3. Emotion is a process. 4. If the appraisal changes, even if the situation does not, then the emotion will change. According to Arnold, people categorically appraise stimulus events and objects as positive or negative. This good/bad appraisal was simply a gut-felt evaluation of the stimulus event. Recent neuroanatomical research confirms Arnold\u2019s claim that the subcortical brain (and amygdala in particular) is the focal brain center that appraises the emotional significance of sensory stimuli (Berridge &amp;amp; Kringelbach, 2008; LeDoux, 2012). In addition, most stimuli are further appraised cortically by adding information processing and hence expectations, memories, beliefs, goals, judgments, and attributions (Davidson &amp;amp; Irwin, 1999; Ochsner &amp;amp; Gross, 2005). Full appraisal therefore draws on both automatic subcortical and reflective cortical evaluations of the stimulus event in terms of sensory information and in terms of the person\u2019s goals and preferences. Once an object has been appraised as good or bad (as beneficial or harmful), an experience of liking or disliking follows immediately and automatically. The motivational reflex model states that any stimulus is automatically categorized as either good or bad, which, in turn, activates the corresponding approach or avoidance motivational system, which, in turn, almost reflexively (automatically) prepares the person to approach the potential benefit or to avoid the potential threat (Eder, Elliot, &amp;amp; Harmon-Jones, 2013).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "8723247e-1e96-11ed-94d7-0eabd5e537a3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmbm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#ffb000", "id": "yp0mla", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Miss_Revival", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 8, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfimprovement/comments/yp0mla/i_read_a_500_page_textbook_on_motivation_so_you/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/yp0mla/i_read_a_500_page_textbook_on_motivation_so_you/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1352067, "created_utc": 1667855666.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfimprovement", "selftext": "Hi!

AFRAID OF DEATH : 07/15/2022 ( sorry for my english)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are a few words of relief to calm my mind and internalize that sometimes things don't happen as expected no matter how much effort you put in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am afraid of death because I have not seen my full potential as a person .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am afraid of death because I have not been able to love or have a family to fight for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am afraid of death because I have not lived long enough to gather unique experiences that will mark my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the truth is that I am afraid of death because I don't want to die a failure. Since I was a child, I have lived certain experiences that have changed my perspective on how to see the world. As a man, I feel I have to leave something, a legacy, a bit of history of what I was at least, because since I was little I was always weak, I had no character, I grew up in a normal environment but I lived experiences that marked my life, bullying at school because of my physical condition and my teeth, bullying with my last name. Few friends and little socialization, I had no parental reference, I did not know how to cope with life, I had to do my best to adapt to the situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere were times when I was very depressed but what could I do, I took refuge in video games at least there I was someone important.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy lack of family education, my inexperience in life, the little family interaction that I had only made me take refuge in video games but I learned a lot from that, I grew up raised by my aunt until I was 16 and from then on I had to create them by myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou know all those experiences until early age were part of my personality, a reserved boy, ignorant, but eager to get out of that situation because I always knew there was something else out of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGrowing up I began to learn more about what life was really about, I had no idea how difficult it can be if you don't have a basis of how society is governed and how you can succeed or beat the system.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI chose a career as a chef but in my move to this career I didn't know how I could make an impact. Similar to Gaston Acurio, I hated everything because of the amount of fat they used.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's when I suffered from bulimia, I lost exorbitant weight because I started to eat and vomit because I didn't know how to lose weight properly, I never knew the importance of the physical development of a man until the end of my years. And this is due to the fact that I always lived locked up, little communication with my mother, little communication from my father on real life issues, no planning on specific things that I could apply. Just a lot of vague advice and generalities that any average parent would give.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStill I learned it on my own, after bulimia and saying enough is enough because it was hurting my esophagus I said I couldn't continue that way and started to educate myself. Food and nutrition and its importance for the optimal development of the human being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore and more I was learning and I liked it because I wanted to make that change I wanted to be another person but I still did not know the reality of the world and society.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTrying marijuana has been the biggest mistake of my life, and I allowed it because the person who gave it to me was a relative, I thought it was harmless and I did it to be able to get to sleep, which affected me so much because of the braces that were put on me very late. At 18 the brackets made more force to the structure of my already developed jaw which caused insomnia. And I had that. Accident in college where I smoked marijuana and fractured my ribs causing a nuemotorax.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy years after that incident were hellish, but my will to live still kept me alive. What my parents did not understand was that the incident caused a number of discomforts in my body and every time I went to the doctor the doctor said that everything was fine, discrediting what he said, you can imagine that frustration.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe truth was that the air pressure that had entered my thorax created a pressure on the side of my heart. Occasionally, every time I was in a certain position or tried to sleep I could not do it because that same pressure generated an atrial fibrillation that is to say a malignant arrhythmia that misconfigured my heartbeat and it was dangerous because it was constantly wearing out the heart causing a cardiac arrest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause of this, I could not get to sleep and as a consequence, not only did it affect more organs but I also had problems like taking pills to be able to sleep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I decided to get ahead, I was a year and a half out of college, I still could not sleep, my heart and eating problems were getting worse and my brain was wearing out due to so much bad rest that I began to have small epileptic seizures. This I did not comment on because what could I do my parents were fed up with me at the time. I remember clearly how bad I was and my mother gave me an ultimatum that I had to leave home or work or go back to school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got a job but in the end I opted for college, it was difficult at first but I was left with a good experience of new friends, new experiences and new people, it was hard to adapt. Not being able to stand out because of my extreme tiredness due to the bad sleep conciliation, I still had to deal with the fact that I was still very weak physically because it was difficult to be able to recompose myself by the same rest. And the few materials I could count on were only my food and my ticket. Sometimes I had to figure out how to make a difference at the university.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I still found the way, it was always the sport, my physical development, my desire to seek something more and be better, my discipline despite going through all that made me remember that I was not doing things in vain, I felt attractive, social and had better experiences in life. Something really wonderful and new for me because I was always that boy who was either insulted or ignored.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything happened and the pandemic created a new perspective about myself, I started to know myself better and to find a way out of my situation. I feel that I always have the capacity for continuous improvement, that's what I always thought about myself, having lived through so many hardships, there had to be a little light at the end of the road.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToo bad that the house where I live is a total fiasco, from the fact that it is destroyed, the constant dirt generated by the dogs that are neglected by the person who adopted them and having to sacrifice myself to be able to. Sleeping in a place in the open because I had no space for me. Stupid decisions of relatives that can drastically affect the life of a human being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I had to adapt, I had no choice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, it is frustrating that I have to live this way, and this is because I just realized that all this is a farce, status, women, society, the rat race, and how those who control the world can affect your life drastically.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI say this because I was forced to get vaccinated the second big mistake I made, my mother forced me , my father also, for the excuse that I had to do it otherwise I couldn't get in somewhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is to be expected ignorant parents believing what the government tells them. I am the only hope for this family and I am dying. That to me is the most frustrating thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything was going smoothly, I had a new symptom, inflammation of the heart from the vaccine, and it was hard for me to get back to training like I was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGod how frustrating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil one day I had an incident with an infection that we didn't know was an infection. My parents saved money by taking me to a bad hospital where they not only put me on pain killers but also injured both arteries in my arms creating large pools of blood on the side of my arms. Not only that, but even with the infection, I had to wait another week and a half to get treatment, which caused further damage to my organs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith time this has been getting worse and worse and counting it is useless because in addition to this I have taken many antibiotic treatments, one more injury in a clinic and several symptoms and serious pictures of infection and inflammation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt frustrates me because everything could have been different, I have suffered too much and yet I have always wanted to be a better man, I have always wanted to stand out, to be able to give and provide for my family, I have been reciprocal, I have helped those in need because it hurts me to see people begging for help because I imagine that if I am not and something happens to my parents I would not forgive myself because it would hurt my soul to have to see my mother on the streets begging for alms or see my father selling candy with a very old age. That's why I want to be better, that's why I always wanted to get my health back to 100%, that's why I want to be my best version.\n\nI learned by myself to never be envious, to have criteria, to be applied and intelligent, I saw a wide future for myself, that is why I am afraid of death because in the end life and other people's circumstances have beaten me and hurt me to the point of being convalescent and on the verge of death.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat is why I am afraid of dying, because despite having suffered so much I will not have my happy ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe God exists and is watching me, he knows that I want to heal myself but my organs can't take it anymore, my kidneys and part of my left lower lung hurt, my brain injured by medical negligence, chronic prostatitis, spinal lubsacion and parasites from the dogs' filth. How can I get out of this , I am not omnipotent, God knows how hard I have tried and still it keeps hurting more and more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do I do? I don't want to go away like this and apprehend from that I am no longer in control. I go to emergency, I have paid for everything, my parents do not even help me or have helped me with a pill, with an exam, or worse the most important thing, to be able to hospitalize me because the pain is hell. I have gone this week 4 times to emergency , on the doctor's recommendation mentioning me hospitalization , but they do not want to help me , and I have no other option but to continue taking painkillers and lengthening the time more .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am afraid to die for it, for not having left this place of this prison of family ignorance for having adapted to the mediocrity of my parents and being a mediocre too, because I am the most mediocre of all because there are times when knowing that I have to do something, I do not do it because I prefer to play or do something else, so I am the most mediocre, now the only thing that kept me at bay with my mediocrity and my condition was my physical development, but now, I have nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut as a man despite being frustrated in this situation I have to be idalgo and recognize , I love my parents with all my heart , they have done everything they could , in their possibilities , no one has a guide as a parent nor anyone has the opportunity to choose where he is born , I am thankful to have lived through all these circumstances and to have been able to form a mature character with a desire to overcome, I love my parents with all my soul and it hurts me not to be able to return at least all the effort and love they gave me, not to be able to at least create more experiences with them or introduce them to my family in a future that is no longer. That hurts me, because despite everything in your most difficult moments you can still count on them and that hurts me and breaks my soul. I do not blame my parents because they can not control the fortuitous circumstances that occur in life, no one can. I just wanted them to see that despite everything and what I have gone through, it did not matter that we could still improve every day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes it is frustrating but I want to be clear here, it frustrates me because I have ambition and goals I want more and I had learned methods to eliminate that mediocrity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would never commit suicide, until the last day of my life I will always have hope, but if I have to go through this, for now I am alone, I have no relatives at this time because they are in other regions, so I will have to go through it alone, and face it as a man. I don't have the money to go to the hospital, but I would have done it already, maybe I would have been diagnosed faster and maybe they would have saved my life. But now, it doesn't matter, the circumstances are different because I don't have anyone so I can't expect anything from anyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am afraid to die because despite this is a bittersweet life and despite being on the verge of death I always look at each day as another day of hope.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I'm going to be honest, the only thing I want is not to be forgotten..........\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHOW TO BE A MAN\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore I leave with the pain of my heart, I do not want to leave empty-handed but at least feel that I have left something of all my pain as a life experience so that this can help more people like me to get out of that situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause the path of a man is hard and difficult but it is the most beautiful and honorable path, because being a man means being brave, being insightful, being constant, being strong, being creative, being a creator.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause the path of a man is to learn from the bitter and strong experiences of life , build character and recognize that we can be our best version every day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause being a man means to me , the best opportunity that life could give me .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGuidance:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany times we do not know key experiences that can mark make a man's life more durable , give him the tools , so he can learn in life , I think the best experience a man can have is to be able to have a strong and wise father figure and a good mother( something I never had and I learned it alone) , and a low economy , because this way , you give the opportunity to the young man to give value to the times of scarcity and life. Assimilating and learning that someday he can aspire to more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Your physical development is one of the most important factors for your emotional, social and personal development.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is because part of our difference with the female gender is that we have the ability to develop an athletic physique that gives us the possibility to face different circumstances in life with more property.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCrudely, society judges you as it sees you, a physical development will give you a boosting, a great improvement in your self-esteem, socially you will be more accepted, you will feel better and more developed, you will feel the ability that you can conquer the world because it is the respect that you earn for yourself, because your physical development can not be bought, it comes from hard work and perseverance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt comes from the combination of nutritional information + proper rest and a good training schedule, it helps you develop discipline and command respect and it will also help you improve your social interactions because the charisma you develop is much more natural because of your confidence and your sense of feeling good about yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDevelop yourself physically, be your strongest and most aesthetic version and with this you will develop various aspects of your life that go along with this work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA man's life is not easy, first understand one thing, men are loved conditionally, that means that if you can't provide, you will be labeled as useless in society and even in your own family.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy this I mean that there are many things in life that will distract you from your main goal, becoming financially free at a young age should be your priority because the world will not tell you but your financial capability will open many doors to life opportunities. Remember that money is a catalyst of time, and with it you can access many things. But in life there are many distractions, women, television stupidities, toxic friendships, meaningless relationships, procrastination, drinks and hallucinogens or other stupid and banal things that retract you from becoming a person who transcends the sheep mentality, the mentality of one more of the system.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor this, you have to seriously focus on developing your physique, your finances and your mind, in order to be truly free in this decaying world. Focus your life on these priorities and you will see that you will be free from the slavery in which many are subjected to. Look above how people think, that in their average are banal and stupid things and do not realize that great powers or people with a lot of purchasing power are subjecting them to a new kind of slavery.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKnowing this , you will know that even though we are loved conditionally , you become the prize if you put the real work into it , only of course , if you get to focus on your priorities . why ? Basically because you will be able to identify who loves you for the sake of full convenience and be able to separate them from your life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe strongest and wisest man is the one who has learned to live with his loneliness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo not be afraid of being alone, do not be afraid of not having friends for a while, free yourself from social networks and banal entertainment that do not lead you to transcend as a person. Because solitude will be your best companion, because in solitude you will be able to know yourself properly and you will be able to identify yourself at another level, because in solitude you will be able to be honest with yourself and recognize that you lack more things to do to be a man of value.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo not depend on the affection of anyone because that makes you weak, do not trust totally or blindly in someone because you can take a bad news. Calibrate people and verify if they are trustworthy or not, you do that when in your worst times they show empathy and strong action of help, action and not just empty words.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNever show emotions of weakness in front of a woman, because usually although they can show a little empathy they are not to be trusted because they are governed by their emotions and social context, this makes them unreliable because if in the social context a wrong circumstance is presented you can be labeled a coward or you can betray or abandon the case in which you are living.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe secret to be successful, that is, to have the expected results in a certain number of parameters that you set to achieve something, is the constancy that the repetition of that action will lead you to be a professional or an expert in that area by the repetition of the subject.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis means that discipline kills talent, discipline is the reason why the poor can become rich, or why an athlete becomes world champion. Now what is discipline?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDiscipline is the fact of doing something constantly, even when you feel you don't feel like doing it, you still do it, why? Because you are a man and as such you have to comply with what you mentioned. Why? because your word is the most valuable thing you can have, because as a man, we value loyalty at a very high level.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the plan is to be disciplined you have to have this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou identify your shortcomings as a person , your negative things , your fears , your circumstances of sorrow or Bull ying that you have lived , unpleasant experiences that have marked you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecond:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow make a list of how you would like to be but write it in a present moment, that is, that you already are, write it this way and every day when you wake up you will read this new positive list that will help you to reprogram your brain and to erase those beliefs that have limited you so much in your life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemember fear is part of life, but it is a thousand times better to receive a no than to ask yourself what would have happened if?......\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThird:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith your brain reprogrammed , you will create and attract better circumstances in life , but this is created with action , remember , the harsh truth is that , if you do not do it ( action ) it will never come , so the reprogramming of your brain serves as a tool to help you take action even in times of panic or in times of greatest embarrassment , because we learn from experiences.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith this, most importantly, grab a piece of paper and identify all the activities of your week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemember that your main objective is , your physical development , your mental development ( sigma ) , your financial development.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe rest comes as a consequence of this good development of the above mentioned.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor this , identify the activities of your week , and plan your week within a calendar , you can use any electronic tool , excel or other tool to do this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLife , a good life , is a calculated life , those who are above all ,did not get there by luck , but by a parameter of calculated decisions so that they can give you the best result.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFourth:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen your weekly planning is ready , you have to include there objectives that bring you closer to this physical development ( gym or a sport ) , financial ( self-taught studies and an improvement of technical knowledge that give you value within the market ) and mental ( meditation , spaces of solitude with music and internalization , go out and start socializing , set yourself social challenges ) that can help you move faster to your goals that you set for yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFifth::\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDevelop discipline , with this you can do it by weekly planning , that is to say you will know at what time what activity you are going to do as well as you can implement new study strategies so you can develop that discipline that sometimes is difficult to master but not impossible , remember MOTIVATION DOES NOT WORK because it may condition you to do things ONLY when you are motivated , the key is to be disciplined and do things even when you do not want to perform it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis will be a great base for you to develop yourself , please , it is important for you to know that you will need a space for you , so it would be good if you have a room of your own , essential for you to be more disciplined , have your own privacy and have your things without anyone checking or watching them because it is a plan for you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNever forget those in need, in life, I have known that helping in a voluntary way is something that fills the soul, and makes you a better person, learn to be reciprocal and manage your possibilities so that every month you can help those who have less. Sometimes giving a little hope gives you the strength to move forward in any circumstances, feed your soul with kindness, be respectful, but also make yourself respected, do not let anyone pass over you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLearn a martial art, learn to fight because it is something fundamental in the respect for oneself, to the discipline and to be able to know moments of danger and know what to do. To protect those who can not, but remember, do it judiciously and in a calculated way so that you do not risk your life in vain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, generate a networking, get out of the bubble that sells you the television or your social status, generate a network of friendships can give you the tools from different perspectives as well as opportunities for growth in real life. Generate networking, lasting friendships, as I said do not be afraid to be alone, but it is always important to have a solid group of friends in which you can rely on or take impulse to achieve your goals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon't blindly believe what the government tells you, do your research and you will save yourself a lot of heartache, research what the vaccine is made of, the side effects it has, the sudden deaths it is causing in young people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tell you this because your most important asset is your health, your health is your most important asset, without it you can not get very far, sometimes the lack of health is the cause of all depressions. take care of your health because with it you will have no limit in your goals. With health you can be whoever you want to be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease, I beg you, do your research and be optimal and calculating with what you ingest and put in your body, be it food, medicine or other substances, one small mistake and your whole life can go down the drain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDepression itself does not exist, rest optimally and focus on what I tell you, your development, physical, monetary and mental because this will give you the opportunity to meet other realities and get out of the cage of your mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe this is not all I have in mind, because I have much more but for the moment this is the basics so that at least you are aware that the road as a man is long but satisfying and more when you have become a reciprocal person, respectful and with a mentality that can conquer many things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy most sincere wishes of improvement in your lives, I say goodbye to you with a smile on my face and with the hope that you will become men who will improve this decadent and corrupt society, good, strong and admirable men, men with words and goals, with a sense of help and self-improvement. I don't know if I will be able to save myself, the symptoms are getting worse but even so I will do the impossible to get out of this, but in case I can't, I am only satisfied to be able to help at least one person with these words.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for my English.

Since I was a child, I have lived certain experiences that have changed my perspective on how to see the world. As a man, I feel I have to leave something, a legacy, a bit of history of what I was at least, because since I was little I was always weak, I had no character, I grew up in a normal environment but I lived experiences that marked my life, bullying at school because of my physical condition and my teeth, bullying with my last name. Few friends and little socialization, I had no parental reference, I did not know how to cope with life, I had to do my best to adapt to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were times when I was very depressed but what could I do, I took refuge in video games at least there I was someone important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My lack of family education, my inexperience in life, the little family interaction that I had only made me take refuge in video games but I learned a lot from that, I grew up raised by my aunt until I was 16 and from then on I had to create them by myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You know all those experiences until early age were part of my personality, a reserved boy, ignorant, but eager to get out of that situation because I always knew there was something else out of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Growing up I began to learn more about what life was really about, I had no idea how difficult it can be if you don&amp;#39;t have a basis of how society is governed and how you can succeed or beat the system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I chose a career as a chef but in my move to this career I didn&amp;#39;t know how I could make an impact. Similar to Gaston Acurio, I hated everything because of the amount of fat they used.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when I suffered from bulimia, I lost exorbitant weight because I started to eat and vomit because I didn&amp;#39;t know how to lose weight properly, I never knew the importance of the physical development of a man until the end of my years. And this is due to the fact that I always lived locked up, little communication with my mother, little communication from my father on real life issues, no planning on specific things that I could apply. Just a lot of vague advice and generalities that any average parent would give.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still I learned it on my own, after bulimia and saying enough is enough because it was hurting my esophagus I said I couldn&amp;#39;t continue that way and started to educate myself. Food and nutrition and its importance for the optimal development of the human being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More and more I was learning and I liked it because I wanted to make that change I wanted to be another person but I still did not know the reality of the world and society.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trying marijuana has been the biggest mistake of my life, and I allowed it because the person who gave it to me was a relative, I thought it was harmless and I did it to be able to get to sleep, which affected me so much because of the braces that were put on me very late. At 18 the brackets made more force to the structure of my already developed jaw which caused insomnia. And I had that. Accident in college where I smoked marijuana and fractured my ribs causing a nuemotorax.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My years after that incident were hellish, but my will to live still kept me alive. What my parents did not understand was that the incident caused a number of discomforts in my body and every time I went to the doctor the doctor said that everything was fine, discrediting what he said, you can imagine that frustration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The truth was that the air pressure that had entered my thorax created a pressure on the side of my heart. Occasionally, every time I was in a certain position or tried to sleep I could not do it because that same pressure generated an atrial fibrillation that is to say a malignant arrhythmia that misconfigured my heartbeat and it was dangerous because it was constantly wearing out the heart causing a cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because of this, I could not get to sleep and as a consequence, not only did it affect more organs but I also had problems like taking pills to be able to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I decided to get ahead, I was a year and a half out of college, I still could not sleep, my heart and eating problems were getting worse and my brain was wearing out due to so much bad rest that I began to have small epileptic seizures. This I did not comment on because what could I do my parents were fed up with me at the time. I remember clearly how bad I was and my mother gave me an ultimatum that I had to leave home or work or go back to school.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got a job but in the end I opted for college, it was difficult at first but I was left with a good experience of new friends, new experiences and new people, it was hard to adapt. Not being able to stand out because of my extreme tiredness due to the bad sleep conciliation, I still had to deal with the fact that I was still very weak physically because it was difficult to be able to recompose myself by the same rest. And the few materials I could count on were only my food and my ticket. Sometimes I had to figure out how to make a difference at the university.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I still found the way, it was always the sport, my physical development, my desire to seek something more and be better, my discipline despite going through all that made me remember that I was not doing things in vain, I felt attractive, social and had better experiences in life. Something really wonderful and new for me because I was always that boy who was either insulted or ignored.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything happened and the pandemic created a new perspective about myself, I started to know myself better and to find a way out of my situation. I feel that I always have the capacity for continuous improvement, that&amp;#39;s what I always thought about myself, having lived through so many hardships, there had to be a little light at the end of the road.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Too bad that the house where I live is a total fiasco, from the fact that it is destroyed, the constant dirt generated by the dogs that are neglected by the person who adopted them and having to sacrifice myself to be able to. Sleeping in a place in the open because I had no space for me. Stupid decisions of relatives that can drastically affect the life of a human being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I had to adapt, I had no choice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, it is frustrating that I have to live this way, and this is because I just realized that all this is a farce, status, women, society, the rat race, and how those who control the world can affect your life drastically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I say this because I was forced to get vaccinated the second big mistake I made, my mother forced me , my father also, for the excuse that I had to do it otherwise I couldn&amp;#39;t get in somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is to be expected ignorant parents believing what the government tells them. I am the only hope for this family and I am dying. That to me is the most frustrating thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything was going smoothly, I had a new symptom, inflammation of the heart from the vaccine, and it was hard for me to get back to training like I was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;God how frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until one day I had an incident with an infection that we didn&amp;#39;t know was an infection. My parents saved money by taking me to a bad hospital where they not only put me on pain killers but also injured both arteries in my arms creating large pools of blood on the side of my arms. Not only that, but even with the infection, I had to wait another week and a half to get treatment, which caused further damage to my organs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With time this has been getting worse and worse and counting it is useless because in addition to this I have taken many antibiotic treatments, one more injury in a clinic and several symptoms and serious pictures of infection and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It frustrates me because everything could have been different, I have suffered too much and yet I have always wanted to be a better man, I have always wanted to stand out, to be able to give and provide for my family, I have been reciprocal, I have helped those in need because it hurts me to see people begging for help because I imagine that if I am not and something happens to my parents I would not forgive myself because it would hurt my soul to have to see my mother on the streets begging for alms or see my father selling candy with a very old age. That&amp;#39;s why I want to be better, that&amp;#39;s why I always wanted to get my health back to 100%, that&amp;#39;s why I want to be my best version.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I learned by myself to never be envious, to have criteria, to be applied and intelligent, I saw a wide future for myself, that is why I am afraid of death because in the end life and other people&amp;#39;s circumstances have beaten me and hurt me to the point of being convalescent and on the verge of death.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is why I am afraid of dying, because despite having suffered so much I will not have my happy ending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe God exists and is watching me, he knows that I want to heal myself but my organs can&amp;#39;t take it anymore, my kidneys and part of my left lower lung hurt, my brain injured by medical negligence, chronic prostatitis, spinal lubsacion and parasites from the dogs&amp;#39; filth. How can I get out of this , I am not omnipotent, God knows how hard I have tried and still it keeps hurting more and more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do I do? I don&amp;#39;t want to go away like this and apprehend from that I am no longer in control. I go to emergency, I have paid for everything, my parents do not even help me or have helped me with a pill, with an exam, or worse the most important thing, to be able to hospitalize me because the pain is hell. I have gone this week 4 times to emergency , on the doctor&amp;#39;s recommendation mentioning me hospitalization , but they do not want to help me , and I have no other option but to continue taking painkillers and lengthening the time more .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am afraid to die for it, for not having left this place of this prison of family ignorance for having adapted to the mediocrity of my parents and being a mediocre too, because I am the most mediocre of all because there are times when knowing that I have to do something, I do not do it because I prefer to play or do something else, so I am the most mediocre, now the only thing that kept me at bay with my mediocrity and my condition was my physical development, but now, I have nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as a man despite being frustrated in this situation I have to be idalgo and recognize , I love my parents with all my heart , they have done everything they could , in their possibilities , no one has a guide as a parent nor anyone has the opportunity to choose where he is born , I am thankful to have lived through all these circumstances and to have been able to form a mature character with a desire to overcome, I love my parents with all my soul and it hurts me not to be able to return at least all the effort and love they gave me, not to be able to at least create more experiences with them or introduce them to my family in a future that is no longer. That hurts me, because despite everything in your most difficult moments you can still count on them and that hurts me and breaks my soul. I do not blame my parents because they can not control the fortuitous circumstances that occur in life, no one can. I just wanted them to see that despite everything and what I have gone through, it did not matter that we could still improve every day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes it is frustrating but I want to be clear here, it frustrates me because I have ambition and goals I want more and I had learned methods to eliminate that mediocrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would never commit suicide, until the last day of my life I will always have hope, but if I have to go through this, for now I am alone, I have no relatives at this time because they are in other regions, so I will have to go through it alone, and face it as a man. I don&amp;#39;t have the money to go to the hospital, but I would have done it already, maybe I would have been diagnosed faster and maybe they would have saved my life. But now, it doesn&amp;#39;t matter, the circumstances are different because I don&amp;#39;t have anyone so I can&amp;#39;t expect anything from anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am afraid to die because despite this is a bittersweet life and despite being on the verge of death I always look at each day as another day of hope.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m going to be honest, the only thing I want is not to be forgotten..........&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;HOW TO BE A MAN&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I leave with the pain of my heart, I do not want to leave empty-handed but at least feel that I have left something of all my pain as a life experience so that this can help more people like me to get out of that situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because the path of a man is hard and difficult but it is the most beautiful and honorable path, because being a man means being brave, being insightful, being constant, being strong, being creative, being a creator.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because the path of a man is to learn from the bitter and strong experiences of life , build character and recognize that we can be our best version every day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because being a man means to me , the best opportunity that life could give me .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Guidance:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many times we do not know key experiences that can mark make a man&amp;#39;s life more durable , give him the tools , so he can learn in life , I think the best experience a man can have is to be able to have a strong and wise father figure and a good mother( something I never had and I learned it alone) , and a low economy , because this way , you give the opportunity to the young man to give value to the times of scarcity and life. Assimilating and learning that someday he can aspire to more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Your physical development is one of the most important factors for your emotional, social and personal development.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is because part of our difference with the female gender is that we have the ability to develop an athletic physique that gives us the possibility to face different circumstances in life with more property.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crudely, society judges you as it sees you, a physical development will give you a boosting, a great improvement in your self-esteem, socially you will be more accepted, you will feel better and more developed, you will feel the ability that you can conquer the world because it is the respect that you earn for yourself, because your physical development can not be bought, it comes from hard work and perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It comes from the combination of nutritional information + proper rest and a good training schedule, it helps you develop discipline and command respect and it will also help you improve your social interactions because the charisma you develop is much more natural because of your confidence and your sense of feeling good about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Develop yourself physically, be your strongest and most aesthetic version and with this you will develop various aspects of your life that go along with this work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A man&amp;#39;s life is not easy, first understand one thing, men are loved conditionally, that means that if you can&amp;#39;t provide, you will be labeled as useless in society and even in your own family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By this I mean that there are many things in life that will distract you from your main goal, becoming financially free at a young age should be your priority because the world will not tell you but your financial capability will open many doors to life opportunities. Remember that money is a catalyst of time, and with it you can access many things. But in life there are many distractions, women, television stupidities, toxic friendships, meaningless relationships, procrastination, drinks and hallucinogens or other stupid and banal things that retract you from becoming a person who transcends the sheep mentality, the mentality of one more of the system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For this, you have to seriously focus on developing your physique, your finances and your mind, in order to be truly free in this decaying world. Focus your life on these priorities and you will see that you will be free from the slavery in which many are subjected to. Look above how people think, that in their average are banal and stupid things and do not realize that great powers or people with a lot of purchasing power are subjecting them to a new kind of slavery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Knowing this , you will know that even though we are loved conditionally , you become the prize if you put the real work into it , only of course , if you get to focus on your priorities . why ? Basically because you will be able to identify who loves you for the sake of full convenience and be able to separate them from your life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The strongest and wisest man is the one who has learned to live with his loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do not be afraid of being alone, do not be afraid of not having friends for a while, free yourself from social networks and banal entertainment that do not lead you to transcend as a person. Because solitude will be your best companion, because in solitude you will be able to know yourself properly and you will be able to identify yourself at another level, because in solitude you will be able to be honest with yourself and recognize that you lack more things to do to be a man of value.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do not depend on the affection of anyone because that makes you weak, do not trust totally or blindly in someone because you can take a bad news. Calibrate people and verify if they are trustworthy or not, you do that when in your worst times they show empathy and strong action of help, action and not just empty words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never show emotions of weakness in front of a woman, because usually although they can show a little empathy they are not to be trusted because they are governed by their emotions and social context, this makes them unreliable because if in the social context a wrong circumstance is presented you can be labeled a coward or you can betray or abandon the case in which you are living.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The secret to be successful, that is, to have the expected results in a certain number of parameters that you set to achieve something, is the constancy that the repetition of that action will lead you to be a professional or an expert in that area by the repetition of the subject.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This means that discipline kills talent, discipline is the reason why the poor can become rich, or why an athlete becomes world champion. Now what is discipline?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Discipline is the fact of doing something constantly, even when you feel you don&amp;#39;t feel like doing it, you still do it, why? Because you are a man and as such you have to comply with what you mentioned. Why? because your word is the most valuable thing you can have, because as a man, we value loyalty at a very high level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the plan is to be disciplined you have to have this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You identify your shortcomings as a person , your negative things , your fears , your circumstances of sorrow or Bull ying that you have lived , unpleasant experiences that have marked you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now make a list of how you would like to be but write it in a present moment, that is, that you already are, write it this way and every day when you wake up you will read this new positive list that will help you to reprogram your brain and to erase those beliefs that have limited you so much in your life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember fear is part of life, but it is a thousand times better to receive a no than to ask yourself what would have happened if?......&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With your brain reprogrammed , you will create and attract better circumstances in life , but this is created with action , remember , the harsh truth is that , if you do not do it ( action ) it will never come , so the reprogramming of your brain serves as a tool to help you take action even in times of panic or in times of greatest embarrassment , because we learn from experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With this, most importantly, grab a piece of paper and identify all the activities of your week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember that your main objective is , your physical development , your mental development ( sigma ) , your financial development.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rest comes as a consequence of this good development of the above mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For this , identify the activities of your week , and plan your week within a calendar , you can use any electronic tool , excel or other tool to do this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Life , a good life , is a calculated life , those who are above all ,did not get there by luck , but by a parameter of calculated decisions so that they can give you the best result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fourth:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When your weekly planning is ready , you have to include there objectives that bring you closer to this physical development ( gym or a sport ) , financial ( self-taught studies and an improvement of technical knowledge that give you value within the market ) and mental ( meditation , spaces of solitude with music and internalization , go out and start socializing , set yourself social challenges ) that can help you move faster to your goals that you set for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fifth::&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Develop discipline , with this you can do it by weekly planning , that is to say you will know at what time what activity you are going to do as well as you can implement new study strategies so you can develop that discipline that sometimes is difficult to master but not impossible , remember MOTIVATION DOES NOT WORK because it may condition you to do things ONLY when you are motivated , the key is to be disciplined and do things even when you do not want to perform it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This will be a great base for you to develop yourself , please , it is important for you to know that you will need a space for you , so it would be good if you have a room of your own , essential for you to be more disciplined , have your own privacy and have your things without anyone checking or watching them because it is a plan for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never forget those in need, in life, I have known that helping in a voluntary way is something that fills the soul, and makes you a better person, learn to be reciprocal and manage your possibilities so that every month you can help those who have less. Sometimes giving a little hope gives you the strength to move forward in any circumstances, feed your soul with kindness, be respectful, but also make yourself respected, do not let anyone pass over you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Learn a martial art, learn to fight because it is something fundamental in the respect for oneself, to the discipline and to be able to know moments of danger and know what to do. To protect those who can not, but remember, do it judiciously and in a calculated way so that you do not risk your life in vain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, generate a networking, get out of the bubble that sells you the television or your social status, generate a network of friendships can give you the tools from different perspectives as well as opportunities for growth in real life. Generate networking, lasting friendships, as I said do not be afraid to be alone, but it is always important to have a solid group of friends in which you can rely on or take impulse to achieve your goals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t blindly believe what the government tells you, do your research and you will save yourself a lot of heartache, research what the vaccine is made of, the side effects it has, the sudden deaths it is causing in young people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tell you this because your most important asset is your health, your health is your most important asset, without it you can not get very far, sometimes the lack of health is the cause of all depressions. take care of your health because with it you will have no limit in your goals.

He just thanked me A LOT of times and also said that he was &amp;quot;literally&amp;quot; happy coz someone told him that he&amp;#39;s good looking and that someone likes him. Lol tbh, I felt as if I was a self-esteem booster there for a moment because of what he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After I said that I like him, I felt a bit disappointed but really sad. I slowly became cold and silent towards him, it annoys me. It is my fault, he&amp;#39;s not to blame but I just can&amp;#39;t help but to be mad at him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Funny thing is, its my birthday tomorrow and this is a huge mood breaker. Lol, I hope something good happens. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I&amp;#39;m actually thinking of blocking/ignoring him. I just can&amp;#39;t face him right now.

Since then, my relationship with my body has gone downhill, and I've fell into a hole of body dysmorphia where I'm not functioning normally anymore. \n\nI just got back from 3 hours of web-surfing on the internet for jaw surgery. Yesterday, I spent 5 hours doing the same. Between my classes today, I was on subreddits like r/vindicta, r/glowup, r/jawsurgery just.. killing time. Every time I see a person's face, my mind autopilots to things that make them attractive: Do they have a high eye canthal tilt? Do they have good mandible growth? The list goes on...  \n\nEver since I found out I have a recessed jaw and bimaxillary protrusion , I've been exponentially more paranoid about my looks. \n\nBefore that, I used to believe that I was just .. unkept. However, the confrontation that my ugliness is rooted in bone anatomy, something I can't fix easily, is keeping me from feeling like I can never be even close to conventionally attractive... and that hurts. \n\nIf you asked me what's wrong with my face - I can name all the problems using medical terms along with the procedures it takes to fix them, the amount each procedure costs, and the surgeons recommended for each procedure. ***That's how far I've gone down the rabbit hole.*** \n\nI'm just.. disappointed that I'm 16 and not even remotely close to where I wanted to be in terms of looks when I was 12. Disney, coming-of-age movies, and cartoons all centers around the teenage girl: she is *16*, she is *chic*, she is *popular*, she is *desired*, she is *cool,* she is *mean* (but it's okay! she's pretty!), and she *draws attention.* \n\nI don't fall under any of those categories. Far from it, actually. \n\nBefore everyone points fingers and rant about how it's \"just media\" - while I do believe part of it is exaggerated and not every girl can look that good in a mini-skirt at 16, I want to say that *there are girls just like this at my school*: gorgeous without trying, center of attention, and flawlessly cool. \n\nI feel .. awkward in the position of being a \"teenage\" girl compared to them.\n\nI used to own my ugliness to my lack of time. I truly believed that I was only unattractive because I didn't spend time caring about makeup or fashion. Instead, I focused all my attention into studying, but as I'm nearing 17, and getting more interested in developing my looks - I'm beginning to realize that .. well, my face isn't meant to be in the same league as those other girls .. and that realization fucking hurts. \n\nI think subconsciously every women makes looking beautiful as one of their life's goals. We're socially conditioned to *be beautiful.* However, for me, being \"pretty\" is the last thing I need to achieve to become something close to \"perfection.\"\n\nI think I'm fairly intelligent. That is something I can say I'm confident about. I think I'm fairly interesting; I can carry conversations and I have a type of humor that's adapted to all ages. However, what I'm missing on the human barometer is looks.. and to think that I won't be able to be \"beautiful\" hurts me. \n\nIt hurts me as my identity as a woman. It hurts me as my identity as a teenager. It hurts me innately, because it's something I believed will come easy once I start \"cleaning up\" .. only to be faced with the fact that I need to shave some bone for me to even qualify. \n\nI posted pictures of myself onto subreddits like r/amiugly the other day, and one user reached out who edited my photos to fix my recessed chin. My profile looks increasingly better that even my sister admit she was alarmed by the results. \n\nHe also gave me some pointers: saying that if I remove the fat from my face (through surgery, it's genetic fat) and fix myself up a bit.. I can be a borderline \"7.\" \n\nThe edit of my profile made the offer very attractive. Now, surgery is on my head even more than ever even if I'm just 16. I understand how absurd it is but I can't help thinking about it all the time. Honestly, I don't think surgery itself is a bad option, If I were older, this definitely wouldn't be a problem .. but I'm 16, and I have other things to worry about, even I know that. \n\nAlso - I want to stop here and talk about why I'm so dedicated to being \"attractive.\" Recently, I've read up on the theory of lookism and data showing that pretty people earn more on average and get more free things in malls/restaurants has made me believe that I ***need to join this exclusive club of women.*** \n\nSeeing all these women being valued for their looks - getting away with speeding, getting free food, having people to their homework - has always been something I knew vaguely about, but now that more and more women are coming out about it, it seems almost inherent that **I need to be one of these women.** \n\nAs shallow as it sounds: I want special privileges too. I want free food. I want people to want to talk to me. I want attention. \n\nI know my value isn't anchored entirely on my looks, but you can't tell me there isn't a correlation between success and looking attractive. I understand that beauty is something to be weaponized, and to miss out on this exclusive weapon as a woman.. it feels almost insulting. **I need to be part of this \"pretty girls club.\"**\n\nAnyways - I really don't know how to feel about all of this. What I don't want is people to read this and say \"looks don't matter! it's what's in the inside that does!\" because the truth is **LOOKS DO MATTER.** They've matter and they will matter for a long time. I **know** that if I was better looking, my life **would** be easier. \n\nHowever, what I don't know is how to accept that I would probably stay average. I .. don't know how to accept that I'm at best, mediocre.. that I, will never receive those privileges and will be expected to work twice as hard as someone who got the job because they have a perfect nose. \n\nAbove all else, I don't know how to stop my mind from running this negative feedback loop of \"I need to be pretty, I need to be pretty, I need to be pretty.\" I can't even function anymore because whenever I face the fact that I dislike how I look, my actions completely shut down. How do I even stay productive in a bag of skin I hate? \n\nI'm tired of being jealous and hateful and I WANT TO CHANGE. But all this talk about pretty privilege, seeing men treat prettier women better, looking at myself and seeing that I'm bone-ugly.. makes me rot in a hell of shame. The worse part is I can't even confront anyone anymore because I'm met with the same feedback of \"you are pretty! pretty is subjective to everyone\" which **further perpetuates the idea that your worth is being beautiful.** \n\n I want someone to tell me that it's okay to be fucking mediocre. That I don't need to be pretty to have worth.. and I need to find a way to actually believe it before all hell breaks loose.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "My (16F) body dysmorphia is ruining my life and I can't function normally.

I understand that beauty is something to be weaponized, and to miss out on this exclusive weapon as a woman.. it feels almost insulting. &lt;strong&gt;I need to be part of this &amp;quot;pretty girls club.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways - I really don&amp;#39;t know how to feel about all of this. What I don&amp;#39;t want is people to read this and say &amp;quot;looks don&amp;#39;t matter! it&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s in the inside that does!&amp;quot; because the truth is &lt;strong&gt;LOOKS DO MATTER.&lt;/strong&gt; They&amp;#39;ve matter and they will matter for a long time. I &lt;strong&gt;know&lt;/strong&gt; that if I was better looking, my life &lt;strong&gt;would&lt;/strong&gt; be easier. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, what I don&amp;#39;t know is how to accept that I would probably stay average. I .. don&amp;#39;t know how to accept that I&amp;#39;m at best, mediocre.. that I, will never receive those privileges and will be expected to work twice as hard as someone who got the job because they have a perfect nose. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Above all else, I don&amp;#39;t know how to stop my mind from running this negative feedback loop of &amp;quot;I need to be pretty, I need to be pretty, I need to be pretty.&amp;quot; I can&amp;#39;t even function anymore because whenever I face the fact that I dislike how I look, my actions completely shut down. How do I even stay productive in a bag of skin I hate? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m tired of being jealous and hateful and I WANT TO CHANGE. But all this talk about pretty privilege, seeing men treat prettier women better, looking at myself and seeing that I&amp;#39;m bone-ugly.. makes me rot in a hell of shame. The worse part is I can&amp;#39;t even confront anyone anymore because I&amp;#39;m met with the same feedback of &amp;quot;you are pretty! pretty is subjective to everyone&amp;quot; which &lt;strong&gt;further perpetuates the idea that your worth is being beautiful.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want someone to tell me that it&amp;#39;s okay to be fucking mediocre. That I don&amp;#39;t need to be pretty to have worth.. and I need to find a way to actually believe it before all hell breaks loose.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmbm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "s22hcp", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 7, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/selfimprovement/comments/s22hcp/my_16f_body_dysmorphia_is_ruining_my_life_and_i/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/s22hcp/my_16f_body_dysmorphia_is_ruining_my_life_and_i/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1352067, "created_utc": 1641980576.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfimprovement", "selftext": "Please stop with these types of posts. \n\nIf you wanna do something, just go do it instead of phishing for karma on Reddit.

Although they tell themselves they are looking for advice, what they really want is sympathy. The problem is, that sympathy doesn\u2019t solve problems. In fact, more often than not, it profounds the problem\n\nDuring my early working years, when I received word of my pending layoff or company\u2019s downsizing as we would say today, I felt the same way most people in that situation would feel. My first reaction was to contact a couple of former employees of the company who had been laid off to see what they were doing. As expected, what I got were tales of disappointment and woe. They had been unable to find jobs and their savings were running low. Bills were piling up and they were at loss as to what they would do. None of the conversations with these people gave me any hope or positive suggestions. Actually, they were downright depressing.\n\nIt is during this time that I remembered my lecturer's advice, to read an hour a day. Since then, one of the books I had read was on goal setting. At that time, it was dull and boring and I wasn\u2019t interested in it. Facing the impending loss of my job and an unknown future, I recalled the message I had gathered from the book: \u201c *If you don\u2019t have goals, you don\u2019t have* direction\u201d. When I asked myself, \u201cWhat do I want out of life?\u201d I realized that I had no idea!\n\nThis revelation was one of the turning points in my life. Now, rather than think about where I could find another job, I was consumed with a thought about what I really wanted out of life. Based on my little work experience at that time, I couldn\u2019t see working a job as anything more than providing me with a living. But like most people, I wanted more out of life than just having a job and normal life. I had dreams of living in a nice big house, driving nice cars, taking exciting vacations, having a yacht, and a number of other things people associate with wealth. The problem was, that I couldn\u2019t see myself ever having these things if I continued as I had been.\n\nThen I remembered what I had read: *that goals, to be meaningful, must be specific, doable, and have a time frame for completion.* And I began to comprehend that *wishes are not goals, goals are what make wishes come true.* What I needed were inspiring goals to guide me in life, goals that, once accomplished, would provide the things for which I wished.\n\nThe more I thought about it, the more aware I became that what I longed for more than anything was financial success. Although I was still young, I was already tired of worrying about where I would get the money for even my basic needs. I recalled many other times when people around me were able to purchase things I would have loved to have or were doing things I would like to do. As, I was facing the loss of my job and the prospect of having to count my money before I could go through the checkout line at the grocery store, surely, this is not the way I wanted to live my life.\n\nOne night as I lay in bed pondering the impending financial difficulties facing me, I suddenly say upright and shouted, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I be rich?\u201d Then it dawned on me that I didn\u2019t have a goal to become rich. How could I expect to achieve a goal that I didn\u2019t have? How would I even know if I made it if I had never defined \u201crich\u201d? I stayed awake pondering the future and finally arrived at a simple statement that defined the goal and would guide me for the next 30 years.\n\nI pick up a notebook and wrote: *I will have $1 million by age 45 and retire by age 55.* That\u2019s all it said, nothing fancy, no comments or suggestions about how to do it, just a simple statement about what I wanted and when I would achieve it.\n\nThe next morning, I took out the notebook and looked at what I\u2019d written: I w*ill have $1 million by age 45 and retire by age 55.* As I stared at the words, a chilling thought passed through my mind: Is this really possible or am I just kidding myself?\u201d The written goal was to have $ 1 million by age 45 let me see that finding another similar job was not the way to go. It didn\u2019t tell me what I should do, but it definitely showed me what not to do.\n\nRecalling the advice my mother had given me as a child, \u201cif you want it badly enough, you\u2019ll find a way to get it,\u201d I know that if I wanted to be successful, I would have to learn from the winners, not losers. If my goal was to have a million dollars by age 45, I would need to seek advice from successful people, people who had achieved success, or at least understood what success was.\n\nAgain I turned to my lecturer for advice. \u201cHaving goals is great, but they need to be realistic\u201d, my lecturer told me. I said, \u201cThe idea came to me a few nights ago, I am now looking for ways that can help make it happen. I know it seems impossible right now, but until I give it my best effort, I\u2018ll never know for sure whether it\u2019s possible or not. Now, I am exploring all options and looking for the best way to get started.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you thought of furthering your studies or taking up a course as this would help you in your career?\u201d my lecturer asked. \u201c I don\u2019t know if it will make you a million dollars by age 45, but if you work at it and are successful, you probably make much more than you\u2019re making now,\u201d he told me.\n\nThat comment got me thinking. I thought about continuing my studies while working, as this would help me in my career progression. Somehow, I got my job back and the first year of studying while at the same time working was difficult. I had to put in more time, more energy than I had previously. Sure, my income was down as I have to supplement my studies, but my knowledge and my spirit were high and I was in control of myself. I rose through the rank and file and didn\u2019t have to worry about being fired or layoff. Through the knowledge gained and from the money I have saved, I invested in properties and made quite a tidy sum. I did not have a million dollars by age 45 but I have enough to live a comfortable life and have not many worries about paying the bills.\n\nThe biggest lesson learned here was also one of the simplest: *Investing requires sacrifice.* Whether it\u2019s time or money, investing means setting it aside for future benefit.

Although they tell themselves they are looking for advice, what they really want is sympathy. The problem is, that sympathy doesn\u2019t solve problems. In fact, more often than not, it profounds the problem&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During my early working years, when I received word of my pending layoff or company\u2019s downsizing as we would say today, I felt the same way most people in that situation would feel. My first reaction was to contact a couple of former employees of the company who had been laid off to see what they were doing. As expected, what I got were tales of disappointment and woe. They had been unable to find jobs and their savings were running low. Bills were piling up and they were at loss as to what they would do. None of the conversations with these people gave me any hope or positive suggestions. Actually, they were downright depressing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is during this time that I remembered my lecturer&amp;#39;s advice, to read an hour a day. Since then, one of the books I had read was on goal setting. At that time, it was dull and boring and I wasn\u2019t interested in it. Facing the impending loss of my job and an unknown future, I recalled the message I had gathered from the book: \u201c &lt;em&gt;If you don\u2019t have goals, you don\u2019t have&lt;/em&gt; direction\u201d. When I asked myself, \u201cWhat do I want out of life?\u201d I realized that I had no idea!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This revelation was one of the turning points in my life. Now, rather than think about where I could find another job, I was consumed with a thought about what I really wanted out of life. Based on my little work experience at that time, I couldn\u2019t see working a job as anything more than providing me with a living. But like most people, I wanted more out of life than just having a job and normal life. I had dreams of living in a nice big house, driving nice cars, taking exciting vacations, having a yacht, and a number of other things people associate with wealth. The problem was, that I couldn\u2019t see myself ever having these things if I continued as I had been.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I remembered what I had read: &lt;em&gt;that goals, to be meaningful, must be specific, doable, and have a time frame for completion.&lt;/em&gt; And I began to comprehend that &lt;em&gt;wishes are not goals, goals are what make wishes come true.&lt;/em&gt; What I needed were inspiring goals to guide me in life, goals that, once accomplished, would provide the things for which I wished.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The more I thought about it, the more aware I became that what I longed for more than anything was financial success. Although I was still young, I was already tired of worrying about where I would get the money for even my basic needs. I recalled many other times when people around me were able to purchase things I would have loved to have or were doing things I would like to do. As, I was facing the loss of my job and the prospect of having to count my money before I could go through the checkout line at the grocery store, surely, this is not the way I wanted to live my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One night as I lay in bed pondering the impending financial difficulties facing me, I suddenly say upright and shouted, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I be rich?\u201d Then it dawned on me that I didn\u2019t have a goal to become rich. How could I expect to achieve a goal that I didn\u2019t have? How would I even know if I made it if I had never defined \u201crich\u201d? I stayed awake pondering the future and finally arrived at a simple statement that defined the goal and would guide me for the next 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pick up a notebook and wrote: &lt;em&gt;I will have $1 million by age 45 and retire by age 55.&lt;/em&gt; That\u2019s all it said, nothing fancy, no comments or suggestions about how to do it, just a simple statement about what I wanted and when I would achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next morning, I took out the notebook and looked at what I\u2019d written: I w&lt;em&gt;ill have $1 million by age 45 and retire by age 55.&lt;/em&gt; As I stared at the words, a chilling thought passed through my mind: Is this really possible or am I just kidding myself?\u201d The written goal was to have $ 1 million by age 45 let me see that finding another similar job was not the way to go. It didn\u2019t tell me what I should do, but it definitely showed me what not to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recalling the advice my mother had given me as a child, \u201cif you want it badly enough, you\u2019ll find a way to get it,\u201d I know that if I wanted to be successful, I would have to learn from the winners, not losers. If my goal was to have a million dollars by age 45, I would need to seek advice from successful people, people who had achieved success, or at least understood what success was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again I turned to my lecturer for advice. \u201cHaving goals is great, but they need to be realistic\u201d, my lecturer told me. I said, \u201cThe idea came to me a few nights ago, I am now looking for ways that can help make it happen. I know it seems impossible right now, but until I give it my best effort, I\u2018ll never know for sure whether it\u2019s possible or not. Now, I am exploring all options and looking for the best way to get started.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHave you thought of furthering your studies or taking up a course as this would help you in your career?\u201d my lecturer asked. \u201c I don\u2019t know if it will make you a million dollars by age 45, but if you work at it and are successful, you probably make much more than you\u2019re making now,\u201d he told me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That comment got me thinking. I thought about continuing my studies while working, as this would help me in my career progression. Somehow, I got my job back and the first year of studying while at the same time working was difficult. I had to put in more time, more energy than I had previously. Sure, my income was down as I have to supplement my studies, but my knowledge and my spirit were high and I was in control of myself. I rose through the rank and file and didn\u2019t have to worry about being fired or layoff. Through the knowledge gained and from the money I have saved, I invested in properties and made quite a tidy sum. I did not have a million dollars by age 45 but I have enough to live a comfortable life and have not many worries about paying the bills.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The biggest lesson learned here was also one of the simplest: &lt;em&gt;Investing requires sacrifice.&lt;/em&gt; Whether it\u2019s time or money, investing means setting it aside for future benefit. If you invest time in learning a new skill or knowledge, that same time can\u2019t be used for fishing, watching a movie, or doing some other fun activities. If you invest money in doing some side business, that money can\u2019t be used to buy a new car, a motorcycle, or purchase some other fun toys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember, what you spend for today pays for today, but what you invest today, pays for tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s all for now my friends.

I think its how I\u2019m distracted. My attention really gets drawn away into usually what is YouTube videos. Although the videos are usually comical in nature, I typically don\u2019t see myself actually laughing out loud as id like to. I feel my mind is so overwhelmed with such shit that I have chosen the easy way out, once again. Its difficult to have to counter my own instinct  behavior, but once I do counter it I start to unravel the onion that is my mental state, the very onion that has been unraveled, but slowly sealed back off. I see that my life has been driven by dopamine since a child. Becoming addicted to porn at such a young age and not realizing the effects into well after high school has taken a huge tole onto the way my brain works. My view of the world and my goal for my way of life is often stomped on and smashed by the shit that I interact with. I wish to live off the land, grow my own crops, and make my own clothing, build some sort of place that I can feel safe and stress free and make the work that I do actually count towards my survival, towards my goal. I never had a goal of having a big house with stuff in it, I have the dream of having a full life with lots of love in it. When things around me get tough I always get hyper sexual as a way to instinctively cope. Its a bad habit and it ruins and degrade every other aspect of my life. Its almost as if I go on safe power mode and the brain only wants stimulation, as if any thoughts or extensive actions get overthrown by the urge to \u201cpress the button when the light comes on\u201d. I know why I do it. It secludes me into my own mind, even if for a minute. The relief from the minute is enough to stop the flashing light, however, once the light stops, I am depleted and has progressed to suicidal fascinations about stopping this vicious cycle of what I am. I had once defeated this \u201cso called demon\u201d by exercising. I had pushed myself in one night to run/walked somewhere around 10-11 miles. I had shinsplints, ran a hole into my shoe (I was wearing old skate shoes that already had wear), and had found a new outlook onto my behavior. I would get up and break a sweat before doing ANYTHING. I had told myself that night that if I could beat off 7 times in a day, while not wanting to do it, I would push myself to keep running. I learned the power of voice that night, I speak what I want into existence, I shout into the sky and relieve my pain, the voice is powerful. Vocalizing to myself that this is not what I want whenever I have an urge is the best path when I can\u2019t take off and run. I had stopped playing video games as I though they too wasted my life, as I now realize that anytime I spent taking breaks from gaming, was the happiest times of my memory. No games, no porn, no jacking off, what ever shall I do with my time? I focused on my health and my body, not the shape, but how it felt. And not until I\u2019m typing these very words did I recall any of this. I had to retrace my steps in my own mind to come to the conclusion that I came to years ago. I want to enjoy my life, not end it. I have knowledge worthy of being proud of. I forgot you must move forward, I keep trying to compare my past experience to times of now, times where it\u2019d seem like I couldn\u2019t be the same man. I must use all that I have experienced over the last couple years and project forward to a new goal. I will never be what I once was, no matter how similar it will become. Everything is different and I have learned very wholesome lessons along the way from then and now. Things I do NOT want to experience again, but if I don\u2019t heed them now and reflect upon myself, I will certain end up repeating them, as I have several times in the past. Major lessons that really are impactful, but the \u201cstress\u201d of the world gets to me and I break down back into a cycle of distraction. No more will I be stuck in the vicious cycle, no more will I sit at night and wonder what will I be. I will be my dream, I will be myself. I will take control of my life with my own intentions. I need to re embrace myself with nature. I need the fresh air and the sunlight to thrive.

I think its how I\u2019m distracted. My attention really gets drawn away into usually what is YouTube videos. Although the videos are usually comical in nature, I typically don\u2019t see myself actually laughing out loud as id like to. I feel my mind is so overwhelmed with such shit that I have chosen the easy way out, once again. Its difficult to have to counter my own instinct  behavior, but once I do counter it I start to unravel the onion that is my mental state, the very onion that has been unraveled, but slowly sealed back off. I see that my life has been driven by dopamine since a child. Becoming addicted to porn at such a young age and not realizing the effects into well after high school has taken a huge tole onto the way my brain works. My view of the world and my goal for my way of life is often stomped on and smashed by the shit that I interact with. I wish to live off the land, grow my own crops, and make my own clothing, build some sort of place that I can feel safe and stress free and make the work that I do actually count towards my survival, towards my goal. I never had a goal of having a big house with stuff in it, I have the dream of having a full life with lots of love in it. When things around me get tough I always get hyper sexual as a way to instinctively cope. Its a bad habit and it ruins and degrade every other aspect of my life. Its almost as if I go on safe power mode and the brain only wants stimulation, as if any thoughts or extensive actions get overthrown by the urge to \u201cpress the button when the light comes on\u201d. I know why I do it. It secludes me into my own mind, even if for a minute. The relief from the minute is enough to stop the flashing light, however, once the light stops, I am depleted and has progressed to suicidal fascinations about stopping this vicious cycle of what I am. I had once defeated this \u201cso called demon\u201d by exercising. I had pushed myself in one night to run/walked somewhere around 10-11 miles. I had shinsplints, ran a hole into my shoe (I was wearing old skate shoes that already had wear), and had found a new outlook onto my behavior. I would get up and break a sweat before doing ANYTHING. I had told myself that night that if I could beat off 7 times in a day, while not wanting to do it, I would push myself to keep running. I learned the power of voice that night, I speak what I want into existence, I shout into the sky and relieve my pain, the voice is powerful. Vocalizing to myself that this is not what I want whenever I have an urge is the best path when I can\u2019t take off and run. I had stopped playing video games as I though they too wasted my life, as I now realize that anytime I spent taking breaks from gaming, was the happiest times of my memory. No games, no porn, no jacking off, what ever shall I do with my time? I focused on my health and my body, not the shape, but how it felt. And not until I\u2019m typing these very words did I recall any of this. I had to retrace my steps in my own mind to come to the conclusion that I came to years ago. I want to enjoy my life, not end it. I have knowledge worthy of being proud of. I forgot you must move forward, I keep trying to compare my past experience to times of now, times where it\u2019d seem like I couldn\u2019t be the same man. I must use all that I have experienced over the last couple years and project forward to a new goal. I will never be what I once was, no matter how similar it will become. Everything is different and I have learned very wholesome lessons along the way from then and now. Things I do NOT want to experience again, but if I don\u2019t heed them now and reflect upon myself, I will certain end up repeating them, as I have several times in the past. Major lessons that really are impactful, but the \u201cstress\u201d of the world gets to me and I break down back into a cycle of distraction. No more will I be stuck in the vicious cycle, no more will I sit at night and wonder what will I be. I will be my dream, I will be myself. I will take control of my life with my own intentions. I need to re embrace myself with nature. I need the fresh air and the sunlight to thrive. No longer will I sit inside and contemplate \u201cwhat to do now\u201d I will get out and do something, if not jus walk. My urge to change myself will not be overwhelmed by any other urge. No longer will I feel victim to myself and these thing I long to change, I will take action and change them, just like I had done in the past. This life is what I make it to be, no longer will I live under the guise that I cannot do something, this is America, I am free, and no longer will I be a slave to a system or
