friends that i trusted and felt like i could almost be myself around, but not quite. ive had feelings of depression since i was 9 years old, mostly stemming from me being autistic causing problems with my lack of social skills, me getting labelled as a problem child, etc. and ive never felt very close to people, and yet these were some of the closest friends ive had in my life.  \n\n\ni was struggling through some intense, heavy feelings. feelings of suicide and intense meltdowns where i hurt myself or screamed until my lungs felt raw. and it got a bit too much for me. i decided i wanted to end it and i attempted twice in the bathroom, not knowing that my methods were too painful and didnt have a chance of working so i was basically guaranteed survival. i went to my dad and just broke down. he tried to be calm for me but he was very shaken by what happened.\n\n  \ni guess i was looking for comfort or support or perhaps a distraction, but i wanted to tell these friends because i couldn't just sit and pretend to be okay for the rest of my life, i just wanted to talk to someone that wasnt my amazing but emotionally awkward dad. i looked up to them because they were all a couple years older than me and more mature, so maybe they could give me the comfort i needed or could listen to my feelings.  \n\n\nso i messaged the group chat i had with them asking to talk to them about 'something heavy' because i didnt want to drop it on them because god knows what anyone is going through that they cant tell to someone else. and i got one reply telling me they werent in the

to reply because again, they 'werent in the headspace.' but what kind of fucking friendship is that where you dont communicate about what youre feeling, and you leave someone so out of the loop that

Every night was just nightmares and memories. Im starting to believe one of my mom's boyfriends raped me when I was little because everyone always said they didn't like him around me and I've been having some flashbacks that don't line up with what I understand of my history. And when I try to have sex or my boyfriend tries to initiate I am paralyzed and just feel this pain deep inside me. I have no will to do anything besides work I wear the same outfit for weeks. \n\nI've been using a system to help keep dishes to a minimum (using only one plate or one cup and forcing myself to reuse it, rather than multiple plates and cups piling up). \n\nI've been working a new job since this all happened and I can tell my bosses and coworkers know something's wrong with me. My boss has tried to talk with me a few times if anything's wrong or if I need help and I appreciate but even if I wanted to take help how could I explain to someone I just met that 20 years of abuse is just now hitting me. I knew my mom wasn't good she's got substance issues and many mental illnesses.\n\n But I never realized how bruised I was from her. I used to be so strong for myself and now I'm a mess, I feel like a failure of a worker, girlfriend and friend to everyone in my life. I used to organize dnd nights and hangouts. But I feel so empty I feel like I don't know who I am. And what I am was just shaped by my mom. I feel like I'm not who I truly am.\n\n Ive been non-stop smoking weed but I honestly don't want to stop and never use it before I drive or work so I see no issue. \n\nI just want to have passion again. My boyfriend helped me clean the kitchen today but I found mold in one of my sauce pans and it just hit me how sad my old self would be to find mold on the pans she used everyday to cook, the same pans her grandma bought for her when she first moved. I used to cook and eat healthy and just care about life. And now I let my pans grow mold because I can't clean up for 5 minutes every day. \n\nI just want to be me again, but the me I know doesn't feel right. \n\nHas anyone felt this way?

I have no will to do anything besides work I wear the same outfit for weeks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been using a system to help keep dishes to a minimum (using only one plate or one cup and forcing myself to reuse it, rather than multiple plates and cups piling up). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been working a new job since this all happened and I can tell my bosses and coworkers know something&amp;#39;s wrong with me. My boss has tried to talk with me a few times if anything&amp;#39;s wrong or if I need help and I appreciate but even if I wanted to take help how could I explain to someone I just met that 20 years of abuse is just now hitting me. I knew my mom wasn&amp;#39;t good she&amp;#39;s got substance issues and many mental illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I never realized how bruised I was from her. I used to be so strong for myself and now I&amp;#39;m a mess, I feel like a failure of a worker, girlfriend and friend to everyone in my life. I used to organize dnd nights and hangouts. But I feel so empty I feel like I don&amp;#39;t know who I am. And what I am was just shaped by my mom. I feel like I&amp;#39;m not who I truly am.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ive been non-stop smoking weed but I honestly don&amp;#39;t want to stop and never use it before I drive or work so I see no issue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just want to have passion again. My boyfriend helped me clean the kitchen today but I found mold in one of my sauce pans and it just hit me how sad my old self would be to find mold on the pans she used everyday to cook, the same pans her grandma bought for her when she first moved. I used to cook and eat healthy and just care about life. And now I let my pans grow mold because I can&amp;#39;t clean up for 5 minutes every day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just want to be me again, but the me I know doesn&amp;#39;t feel right. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Has anyone felt this way? I always thought depressions came and went but you&amp;#39;d go back to being yourself. But I don&amp;#39;t see myself coming out of this as that same girl and I&amp;#39;m scared of who I might be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort":

recently learned i have some trauma from early early childhood and that explains why i was always so in my head, in my own little world, anxious to the point it&amp;#39;s crippling, i finally &amp;quot;woke up&amp;quot; and now i have psychosis, ocd, severe depression and anxiety, ptsd, im a mess. i had a job a few months ago, it got really slow and i wasn&amp;#39;t making money so i found a new job. they said i was hired so i quit my previous one, then they said i was no longer needed because they&amp;#39;re slow too. so since then i&amp;#39;ve been unemployed. had a few job opportunities that i bailed on. including today i was supposed to start at a warehouse. i just get too scared, to the point i just want to end it to free myself of this terror i put myself through on a daily basis. i can not function as a human being at all, but i don&amp;#39;t have time to wait to get on disability, i have no money and need to pay rent by the first of next month, and i have a daughter that needs me. i don&amp;#39;t know what to do, i don&amp;#39;t take my meds because they make me so exhausted, to the point where i can literally sleep for 24 hours and getting up to do any form of work makes me anxious because i&amp;#39;m so tired. right now i&amp;#39;m staring at a belt and contemplating taking all these different meds i&amp;#39;ve been given because my dr changed them biweekly before he abruptly quit working at this office before our next appt and now i don&amp;#39;t have a dr. it&amp;#39;s 11:30am i&amp;#39;m almost drunk and high off my ass because im so ashamed

She lives 4 hours away from me and we see each other a few times during the summer until I\u2019m back in that city for college. We all got drunk and we went back to her house and it was around 1 am and I had to drive back home because my parents needed me back home. I was an emotional wreck. I was having fights with her parents and they were yelling at me and I started to cut my wrists and I drove back home drunk. I\u2019m a Muslim and she\u2019s not and my parents don\u2019t like the idea of us being together. Her entire family hates me now. Yesterday her brother in law and step sister told her that I said to them that I was cheating throughout our relationship. I never was. Idk why I\u2019d say such a lie like that but I did. I was so drunk that I don\u2019t even remember saying it. I could never cheat on her. She was the only girl I loved. I can still feel her arm around me at night. I can still hear her laugh. I still remember the feeling of being happy when I was next to her. She broke up with me and never wants to speak to me again. My entire world was ruined because of a lie I told when I was drunk. It\u2019s sad how I ruin everything. I could never cheat on anybody. Ik it hurts and I could never put anyone through that pain. I never lied to her when we started dating. I came clean about everything. I would always be honest with her about everything but a drunken lie ruined it. She\u2019ll never trust me and I\u2019ve hurt her. She was the only one who loved me for who I am. She was patient with me. She\u2019s the reason that I started to go to therapy. My BPD controls my life and I don\u2019t want it to. I lost the only girl to have ever loved me so much that she tried to help me with my BPD. All she did was love me but I just kept hurting her. I never meant to. Our relationship wasn\u2019t toxic. All I did was love her but now she doesn\u2019t believe a word I say. Her mom told me to leave her alone. I feel so empty inside. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever love anyone the way I loved her and no one will love me the way she did. I don\u2019t and won\u2019t commit suicide because she taught me that I have something to live for. I\u2019m just depressed but I won\u2019t drink or take drugs because it\u2019ll just make it worse for me. I\u2019m gonna cut that out of my life now. I\u2019m done drinking and doing drugs. We were so happy together and we worked together to overcome our problems (mainly with my BPD) but now I have no one. I\u2019ll move back to the city for college soon and I\u2019ll just be alone. I don\u2019t have friends there anymore and now I lost the only one I loved and trusted. Ive cried and cried and my mom was right next to me telling me that I have something to live for and it\u2019s not the end of the world and she\u2019s been supporting me and making sure I\u2019m okay but Ik once I move back then things will get worse knowing that we were gonna be happy together when I moved back and knowing she\u2019s just 10 minutes away from where I\u2019ll be living. We were gonna sleep together, I was gonna kiss her goodnight every night, I was gonna cook for her, we were gonna have sex everywhere in the apartment, we were gonna be happy together. We said that we\u2019d marry each other but now Ik that it won\u2019t happen. My birthday is coming up and Ik she won\u2019t be there to celebrate it with me but I\u2019ll just be alone like how I am every year. It\u2019s sad that because of my BPD, I let my emotions control me and I ruin my relationships with everyone. I\u2019m trying to get better but something always happens to set it back. I feel lost and empty without the one I love. She was my fp and now I\u2019ve lost her. I cant blame her for anything. She never did anything wrong. I\u2019m just mad at myself. My emotions take control of me and I hurt everyone around me. In just 2 days my entire world came crashing down and I never thought it would happen. I\u2019m just so sick and tired of my mental health hurting me and others around me. I never knew how much it could affect my life but now I do. I never meant to hurt her or anyone but I guess I get what I deserve. It\u2019s hard for someone to love me. All I end up doing is hurting the ones I love. I wish I was normal. I wish I could take it all back. It\u2019s sad how no one understands people with BPD and even when they try, you just end up hurting them. And it's been so hard to handle the pressure, worse before it'll get better, scared that I'm drowning but I keep going, I have to ease it up. Bury my head in the sand, but I'll be a better man. I just close my eyes and pray that I'll be fine. Now I\u2019ll forever be hated by her and her family but they\u2019ll never hate me as much as I hate myself. I don\u2019t want BPD and I want to be normal. I let everyone down in my life. Ik she\u2019ll get over me quickly and move on and be happy but it\u2019s gonna take me a long time to get over her. She won\u2019t remember the great and happy times we had together. She\u2019ll just remember me as the boyfriend she hated. All I wanted was to make her happy and smile. I keep reading the letters she wrote me and Ik that she loved me. I tried to get better and she saw me make progress. She believed in me. Everything reminds me of her. I can\u2019t even watch a movie without remembering that we watched it together and she fell asleep on my chest. We used to have silly arguments like who\u2019s the hotter Hemsworth brother. Now I can\u2019t even watch Thor without crying. I bought the same body wash as her because it smelled like her and she loved it. Now I\u2019m too scared to even step into my bathroom and my PTSD takes over. She gave me so much. She loved me for who I am and what I can be. She was the best thing that ever happened to me and all I can think about are the memories we made together. I wish I was normal. Ik I\u2019ve made mistakes but I\u2019m changing. I just hurt everyone around me. I\u2019ll never love the same again. I\u2019ll never be happy and everything is this way because it\u2019s always my fault. I hope she\u2019s able to read this but Ik I\u2019ll just get more backlash from her and her family. I\u2019ll always be hated. I just wanna vent in a safe space around people with BPD just like me and get help. I hope she can understand that I never meant to hurt her and all I wanted was to love her. I never lied to her. I couldn\u2019t lie to her. I was always honest with her but she won\u2019t ever believe me. I don\u2019t want her to ever blame herself for what\u2019s happened to me. I\u2019ve been dealing with it for most of my life. Breakups happen and it\u2019s affects me more because of my mental state. I\u2019ll keep going to therapy and keep trying to become a better person and I pray and hope that she\u2019s there to see me make progress because me getting better is all because of her.

She lives 4 hours away from me and we see each other a few times during the summer until I\u2019m back in that city for college. We all got drunk and we went back to her house and it was around 1 am and I had to drive back home because my parents needed me back home. I was an emotional wreck. I was having fights with her parents and they were yelling at me and I started to cut my wrists and I drove back home drunk. I\u2019m a Muslim and she\u2019s not and my parents don\u2019t like the idea of us being together. Her entire family hates me now. Yesterday her brother in law and step sister told her that I said to them that I was cheating throughout our relationship. I never was. Idk why I\u2019d say such a lie like that but I did. I was so drunk that I don\u2019t even remember saying it. I could never cheat on her. She was the only girl I loved. I can still feel her arm around me at night. I can still hear her laugh. I still remember the feeling of being happy when I was next to her. She broke up with me and never wants to speak to me again. My entire world was ruined because of a lie I told when I was drunk. It\u2019s sad how I ruin everything. I could never cheat on anybody. Ik it hurts and I could never put anyone through that pain. I never lied to her when we started dating. I came clean about everything. I would always be honest with her about everything but a drunken lie ruined it. She\u2019ll never trust me and I\u2019ve hurt her. She was the only one who loved me for who I am. She was patient with me. She\u2019s the reason that I started to go to therapy. My BPD controls my life and I don\u2019t want it to. I lost the only girl to have ever loved me so much that she tried to help me with my BPD. All she did was love me but I just kept hurting her. I never meant to. Our relationship wasn\u2019t toxic. All I did was love her but now she doesn\u2019t believe a word I say. Her mom told me to leave her alone. I feel so empty inside. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever love anyone the way I loved her and no one will love me the way she did. I don\u2019t and won\u2019t commit suicide because she taught me that I have something to live for. I\u2019m just depressed but I won\u2019t drink or take drugs because it\u2019ll just make it worse for me. I\u2019m gonna cut that out of my life now. I\u2019m done drinking and doing drugs. We were so happy together and we worked together to overcome our problems (mainly with my BPD) but now I have no one. I\u2019ll move back to the city for college soon and I\u2019ll just be alone. I don\u2019t have friends there anymore and now I lost the only one I loved and trusted. Ive cried and cried and my mom was right next to me telling me that I have something to live for and it\u2019s not the end of the world and she\u2019s been supporting me and making sure I\u2019m okay but Ik once I move back then things will get worse knowing that we were gonna be happy together when I moved back and knowing she\u2019s just 10 minutes away from where I\u2019ll be living. We were gonna sleep together, I was gonna kiss her goodnight every night, I was gonna cook for her, we were gonna have sex everywhere in the apartment, we were gonna be happy together. We said that we\u2019d marry each other but now Ik that it won\u2019t happen. My birthday is coming up and Ik she won\u2019t be there to celebrate it with me but I\u2019ll just be alone like how I am every year. It\u2019s sad that because of my BPD, I let my emotions control me and I ruin my relationships with everyone. I\u2019m trying to get better but something always happens to set it back. I feel lost and empty without the one I love. She was my fp and now I\u2019ve lost her. I cant blame her for anything. She never did anything wrong. I\u2019m just mad at myself. My emotions take control of me and I hurt everyone around me. In just 2 days my entire world came crashing down and I never thought it would happen. I\u2019m just so sick and tired of my mental health hurting me and others around me. I never knew how much it could affect my life but now I do. I never meant to hurt her or anyone but I guess I get what I deserve. It\u2019s hard for someone to love me. All I end up doing is hurting the ones I love. I wish I was normal. I wish I could take it all back. It\u2019s sad how no one understands people with BPD and even when they try, you just end up hurting them. And it&amp;#39;s been so hard to handle the pressure, worse before it&amp;#39;ll get better, scared that I&amp;#39;m drowning but I keep going, I have to ease it up. Bury my head in the sand, but I&amp;#39;ll be a better man. I just close my eyes and pray that I&amp;#39;ll be fine. Now I\u2019ll forever be hated by her and her family but they\u2019ll never hate me as much as I hate myself. I don\u2019t want BPD and I want to be normal. I let everyone down in my life. Ik she\u2019ll get over me quickly and move on and be happy but it\u2019s gonna take me a long time to get over her. She won\u2019t remember the great and happy times we had together. She\u2019ll just remember me as the boyfriend she hated. All I wanted was to make her happy and smile. I keep reading the letters she wrote me and Ik that she loved me. I tried to get better and she saw me make progress. She believed in me. Everything reminds me of her. I can\u2019t even watch a movie without remembering that we watched it together and she fell asleep on my chest. We used to have silly arguments like who\u2019s the hotter Hemsworth brother. Now I can\u2019t even watch Thor without crying. I bought the same body wash as her because it smelled like her and she loved it. Now I\u2019m too scared to even step into my bathroom and my PTSD takes over. She gave me so much. She loved me for who I am and what I can be. She was the best thing that ever happened to me and all I can think about are the memories we made together. I wish I was normal. Ik I\u2019ve made mistakes but I\u2019m changing. I just hurt everyone around me. I\u2019ll never love the same again. I\u2019ll never be happy and everything is this way because it\u2019s always my fault. I hope she\u2019s able to read this but Ik I\u2019ll just get more backlash from her and her family. I\u2019ll always be hated. I just wanna vent in a safe space around people with BPD just like me and get help. I hope she can understand that I never meant to hurt her and all I wanted was to love her. I never lied to her. I couldn\u2019t lie to her. I was always honest with her but she won\u2019t ever believe me. I don\u2019t want her to ever blame herself for what\u2019s happened to me. I\u2019ve been dealing with it for most of my life. Breakups happen and it\u2019s affects me more because of my mental state. I\u2019ll keep going to therapy and keep trying to become a better person and I pray and hope that she\u2019s there to see me make progress because me getting better is all because of her. She never did anything wrong. She just loved me. I wish we could start over and be happy. I wish we could love each other the way we did. I wish you can trust me again. You may hate me and call me a liar but Ik deep down that you know I\u2019m a good person and that I was always honest with you and that I love you more than anything in the world. You said it yourself and always told me but I\u2019ve ruined the way you view me. Ik you\u2019ll never want to be with me and I wish we could. Making you smile and happy was the only thing I wanted.

I read it and my suffering just seems so puny to me now that I&amp;#39;m growing older and am about to hit 25 next year so my prefrontal cortex will become fully developed and I will no longer be a boy but a man. And now when I look back at all this stuff I did as a kid, teen and young adult as pathetic shit only a puny kid would do or say. I even looked like a puny kid. But as I am now older, I can see myself developing. Let me make this clear that 18 is not &amp;quot;adult&amp;quot; it is oversized child, that&amp;#39;s it. Brain developmemt matters far more than sexual development. And I feel kinda neutral to all this. I don&amp;#39;t really care about all this old stuff, I want to act like a man and be a man. Not some fucking kid. Weird how the weed + age progression kinda changed the course of my post history in a single day.

Im prescribed Zoloft 75mg but I hate pharmaceuticals so I don\u2019t take my meds, I haven\u2019t in roughly 8 months. My GAD is insane, and my depression is getting worse. Currently \u201chomeless\u201d, and staying with friends until I find my own place. Got 30 credits in high school right now, so that\u2019s a wrap. So now I just work 5 days a week at a job that I love, but hate at the same time because it\u2019s so fucking repetitive. I\u2019ve been struggling with alcohol addiction since I was 15. Got sober on my 18th birthday for 9 months and relapsed right on my 9 month mark when I got kicked out of the place I was staying. So for the past 2 months I\u2019ve drank almost everyday, pretty hard too. I know that\u2019s taking a big tole on my mental health, but it\u2019s almost like I\u2019m afraid of my thoughts when I\u2019m sober. I struggle with bad suicidal thoughts, which I don\u2019t want to act upon at all, because you see, I want to live, but I don\u2019t want to live the life I\u2019ve been given/made for myself. I\u2019m tired of thinking, I think way too fucking much. Something that gets me a lot of the uncertainty of life. Why are we here? Am I real? What put us here? Is anything real? Am I god? Am I nothing? That\u2019s just an example of my daily thoughts, sort of dimmed down. And I\u2019m torn between wanting to off myself to get rid of the thoughts, but at the same time, what happens after we die? Maybe We just get tossed into an eternity of ourselves and our minds. I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m writing this right now, I just need to dump my fucked up mind somewhere. \nI see my psychiatrist on august 29th, but literally every single day my thoughts get worse and I\u2019m scared I won\u2019t make it till then without going insane. And what good does a psychiatrist really do? They can\u2019t see into my mind and actually fully understand what\u2019s going on. They just toss some medication at you until your brain is numbed. I think my mental illness goes a lot deeper then just GAD and depression, but I don\u2019t know how to go about getting evaluated. I think I might have OCD. I definitely have a lot of trauma from my childhood and from my mom passing, it\u2019s all catching up to me now and I\u2019m realizing how fucked up my life has really been, and how much I\u2019ve ruined for myself.

Im prescribed Zoloft 75mg but I hate pharmaceuticals so I don\u2019t take my meds, I haven\u2019t in roughly 8 months. My GAD is insane, and my depression is getting worse. Currently \u201chomeless\u201d, and staying with friends until I find my own place. Got 30 credits in high school right now, so that\u2019s a wrap. So now I just work 5 days a week at a job that I love, but hate at the same time because it\u2019s so fucking repetitive. I\u2019ve been struggling with alcohol addiction since I was 15. Got sober on my 18th birthday for 9 months and relapsed right on my 9 month mark when I got kicked out of the place I was staying. So for the past 2 months I\u2019ve drank almost everyday, pretty hard too. I know that\u2019s taking a big tole on my mental health, but it\u2019s almost like I\u2019m afraid of my thoughts when I\u2019m sober. I struggle with bad suicidal thoughts, which I don\u2019t want to act upon at all, because you see, I want to live, but I don\u2019t want to live the life I\u2019ve been given/made for myself. I\u2019m tired of thinking, I think way too fucking much. Something that gets me a lot of the uncertainty of life. Why are we here? Am I real? What put us here? Is anything real? Am I god? Am I nothing? That\u2019s just an example of my daily thoughts, sort of dimmed down. And I\u2019m torn between wanting to off myself to get rid of the thoughts, but at the same time, what happens after we die? Maybe We just get tossed into an eternity of ourselves and our minds. I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m writing this right now, I just need to dump my fucked up mind somewhere. \nI see my psychiatrist on august 29th, but literally every single day my thoughts get worse and I\u2019m scared I won\u2019t make it till then without going insane. And what good does a psychiatrist really do? They can\u2019t see into my mind and actually fully understand what\u2019s going on. They just toss some medication at you until your brain is numbed. I think my mental illness goes a lot deeper then just GAD and depression, but I don\u2019t know how to go about getting evaluated. I think I might have OCD. I definitely have a lot of trauma from my childhood and from my mom passing, it\u2019s all catching up to me now and I\u2019m realizing how fucked up my life has really been, and how much I\u2019ve ruined for myself. I miss who I was before my mental health just plummeted. \nBut again, like I said, I\u2019m just kind of dumping my mind here. \nI\u2019m so sorry to anyone who\u2019s going through this shit or any other mental health issues. I love you, and I send my wishes that you will get better and life will be easier.

My manager told me to \u201cration\u201d my medicine. At home, I am not in a happy place. We bought a new home, but my fianc\u00e9 is a recovering addict and he\u2019s struggling. I\u2019ve tried in every way possible to help him stay on track but when he doesn\u2019t see the issues, he doesn\u2019t feel he needs to change any behaviors. This alone is exhausting. Our relationship is horrible\u2026 trust gone, no intimacy, no romance, nothing. My dad was diagnosed with stage 3 stomach cancer and he\u2019s in Mexico (I\u2019m in the US). I got to see him for 9 days in March, but it basically killed me with guilt to leave his side.

I apologize in advance if it is\u2026 \nI\u2019m exhausted. In every way possible. I work in mental health as a peer support person\u2026 (ironic huh?) my job is the only thing that gives me fulfillment. Here recently my work will not let me take off to take care of my teeth (lots of pain), get controlled substances refilled at my doctors, or even see my therapist. My manager told me to \u201cration\u201d my medicine. At home, I am not in a happy place. We bought a new home, but my fianc\u00e9 is a recovering addict and he\u2019s struggling. I\u2019ve tried in every way possible to help him stay on track but when he doesn\u2019t see the issues, he doesn\u2019t feel he needs to change any behaviors. This alone is exhausting. Our relationship is horrible\u2026 trust gone, no intimacy, no romance, nothing. My dad was diagnosed with stage 3 stomach cancer and he\u2019s in Mexico (I\u2019m in the US). I got to see him for 9 days in March, but it basically killed me with guilt to leave his side.

"num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext": "One night a colleague asked me on a date and I felt so flattered. After two weeks he told me something came up in his life and cant deal with a new friendship at the moment. I understood and tried to move on but some days later he told me he wanted us to have sex. Again I felt flattered but I refused because I wasn't ready at the moment for a sexual relationship. Again, after some days I asked him to cuddle, he said he didn't feel like he could be so vulnerable at the moment but he was okay with having sex. I refused and told him to announce me when he was ready to be vulnerable. Again, after days passed and I felt more confident due to my antidepressant treatment I told him I was ready to have sex and he didn't outright refused but he told me hell think about it after exam week but he wont promise anything. After some more days I asked him to meet but he said he planned to see his girlfriend that evening. That night I had the first mental breakdown in a long time. I took a really high amount of benzo, left my door unlocked so someone will find me in case something happens because I live alone, and I seriously considered calling suicide line because I felt the need to talk to someone.\n\nThis whole episode went on for 6 months. 6 months of confusion, and trying to push a relationship, and at the end of it I still had not have a date or had sex with this guy.\n\nDuring this months I tried to have conversations with this guy, tried to build a relationship with him because I really thought he had a hard time and was busy balancing college and a job and I didn't want the things to fizzle between us. I brushed off all of the signs that he wasn't interested (never initiating conversation, never sending memes, always refusing to meet) and concentrated on the signs of interest (glancing at me during class, fixing his appearance around me, his awkwardness around me, the heart reacts on Instagram). \n\nWhat pisses me off the most its not that he chose another girl, its that I always had that gut feeling that he lost interest but I didn't want to be that paranoid kind of girl and I always told myself that I had no reason not to trust him because during our conversations I always mentioned to him how I trust him and how he can always tell me anything because I will not mind because the meds numb my feelings. I had trust that he will tell me he lost interest.\n\nI vented that night all of my thoughts to him but he still does not want to be vulnerable around me and tell me his feelings. He told me its not alright of me to judge his relationship decisions, that he did not ask me to wait for him, and that he was indeed not ready for a relationship at that time but changed his mind over time and decided he did not want a relationship with me. And I understand but wished he had told me because all of this time i waited and hoped there could be something between us. \n\nI asked me since when are they together. He said 1 month. I asked twice since when did they know each other and he refused to answer and said he did not want to talk about this anymore. If he doesn't want to talk about it then I assume he met her after he first asked me on a date. I just want to pinpoint exactly when was that. If he pursued this girl then why didn't he refuse sex with me? What did she have that made him change his mind regarding a relationship when he never even tried to initiate a conversation with me?\n\nI feel so stupid for clinging to the hope having a relationship with this guy but he is the first guy that ever asked me on a date, the first guy that felt sexual attraction for me at some point and it really boosted my confidence and I really felt a connection with him. I didn't hope for a serious relationship with this guy but I hoped we could at least have a casual relationship because I have no dating experience and who knows when I will have that opportunity again. I feel pathetic for getting attached to people that show me a crumb of attention. I feel jealous of people that form friendships so quick and jump from relationship to relationship. I feel pathetic because I know that I haven't wronged this guy but still I was the one that felt the need to apologize for putting him in an uncomfortable situation. I feel pathetic because I can still forgive him and still consider a relationship with him and I don't mind being used just for sex because I have a really low self esteem. I blame myself because he lost interest in me. I cant stop thinking about what I did or didn't do to him.\n\nI just wish he could be vulnerable with me and tell me what was his thought process during all this time. I acknowledge the fact that most probably their relationship wont last and that I will move on at some point but still I feel like I wont ever have physical and emotional intimacy with someone.

After two weeks he told me something came up in his life and cant deal with a new friendship at the moment. I understood and tried to move on but some days later he told me he wanted us to have sex. Again I felt flattered but I refused because I wasn&amp;#39;t ready at the moment for a sexual relationship. Again, after some days I asked him to cuddle, he said he didn&amp;#39;t feel like he could be so vulnerable at the moment but he was okay with having sex. I refused and told him to announce me when he was ready to be vulnerable. Again, after days passed and I felt more confident due to my antidepressant treatment I told him I was ready to have sex and he didn&amp;#39;t outright refused but he told me hell think about it after exam week but he wont promise anything. After some more days I asked him to meet but he said he planned to see his girlfriend that evening. That night I had the first mental breakdown in a long time. I took a really high amount of benzo, left my door unlocked so someone will find me in case something happens because I live alone, and I seriously considered calling suicide line because I felt the need to talk to someone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This whole episode went on for 6 months. 6 months of confusion, and trying to push a relationship, and at the end of it I still had not have a date or had sex with this guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During this months I tried to have conversations with this guy, tried to build a relationship with him because I really thought he had a hard time and was busy balancing college and a job and I didn&amp;#39;t want the things to fizzle between us. I brushed off all of the signs that he wasn&amp;#39;t interested (never initiating conversation, never sending memes, always refusing to meet) and concentrated on the signs of interest (glancing at me during class, fixing his appearance around me, his awkwardness around me, the heart reacts on Instagram). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What pisses me off the most its not that he chose another girl, its that I always had that gut feeling that he lost interest but I didn&amp;#39;t want to be that paranoid kind of girl and I always told myself that I had no reason not to trust him because during our conversations I always mentioned to him how I trust him and how he can always tell me anything because I will not mind because the meds numb my feelings. I had trust that he will tell me he lost interest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I vented that night all of my thoughts to him but he still does not want to be vulnerable around me and tell me his feelings. He told me its not alright of me to judge his relationship decisions, that he did not ask me to wait for him, and that he was indeed not ready for a relationship at that time but changed his mind over time and decided he did not want a relationship with me. And I understand but wished he had told me because all of this time i waited and hoped there could be something between us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked me since when are they together. He said 1 month. I asked twice since when did they know each other and he refused to answer and said he did not want to talk about this anymore. If he doesn&amp;#39;t want to talk about it then I assume he met her after he first asked me on a date. I just want to pinpoint exactly when was that. If he pursued this girl then why didn&amp;#39;t he refuse sex with me? What did she have that made him change his mind regarding a relationship when he never even tried to initiate a conversation with me?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel so stupid for clinging to the hope having a relationship with this guy but he is the first guy that ever asked me on a date, the first guy that felt sexual attraction for me at some point and it really boosted my confidence and I really felt a connection with him. I didn&amp;#39;t hope for a serious relationship with this guy but I hoped we could at least have a casual relationship because I have no dating experience and who knows when I will have that opportunity again. I feel pathetic for getting attached to people that show me a crumb of attention. I feel jealous of people that form friendships so quick and jump from relationship to relationship. I feel pathetic because I know that I haven&amp;#39;t wronged this guy but still I was the one that felt the need to apologize for putting him in an uncomfortable situation. I feel pathetic because I can still forgive him and still consider a relationship with him and I don&amp;#39;t mind being used just for sex because I have a really low self esteem. I blame myself because he lost interest in me. I cant stop thinking about what I did or didn&amp;#39;t do to him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just wish he could be vulnerable with me and tell me what was his thought process during all this time. I acknowledge the fact that most probably their relationship wont last and that I will move on at some point but still I feel like I wont ever have physical and emotional intimacy with someone. I acknowledge the fact the the relationship between us its still not strained and there its still the chance of something between us. I acknowledge the fact that this episode was an essential step in my development but it was so confusing and emotionally draining.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am really thankful I started my antidepressant treatment months ago because even thought its emotionally numbing it helps me have rational thoughts, and I can function in my day-to-day life.
