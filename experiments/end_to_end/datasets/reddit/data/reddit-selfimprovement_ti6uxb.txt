I am writing this in regards to what\u2019s going on here at Pocahontas State Correctional Center in Virginia and I here is indicative of prisons across the US. We are on modified lockdown due to staff bringing in Covid-19 again. We are supposed to be separated- top tier, bottom tier- but they make us walk to the chow hall together, go outside together and let each tier mingle with the next. They let inmates handle and pass out face masks. Unfortunately, half the staff doesn\u2019t wear face masks and they threaten us with charges if we don\u2019t have ours on. They are steadily conducting cell searches walking into a two-man cell with two and three staff members at a time. They they proceed the next cell without changing their gloves. Protocol instructs them to bring our trays to us since a pod in our building has positive cases, but we are made us walk to the chow hall. Apparently, it saves them money because not everyone walks to get food. Yet, if they have to bring the trays to us then they have to prepare a tray for everyone in the pod. In building A pod they have positive cases and staff steadily go in and out, directly into the next pods. They are often not wearing a face mask and never wearing gloves. potentially spreading the virus. Yesterday between 9:45 AM and 10:00 AM in A.3 pod the assistant warden was walking around the pod not wearing a face mask. On 1.20.22 between 8 and 8:30AM staff conducted Covid tests to the pod without changing their gloves after handling each test. The staff here has zero regard for our health and safety. They openly make remarks about the virus not being serious and tell us we are crazy for getting an experimental vaccine.

I am writing this in regards to what\u2019s going on here at Pocahontas State Correctional Center in Virginia and I here is indicative of prisons across the US. We are on modified lockdown due to staff bringing in Covid-19 again. We are supposed to be separated- top tier, bottom tier- but they make us walk to the chow hall together, go outside together and let each tier mingle with the next. They let inmates handle and pass out face masks. Unfortunately, half the staff doesn\u2019t wear face masks and they threaten us with charges if we don\u2019t have ours on. They are steadily conducting cell searches walking into a two-man cell with two and three staff members at a time. They they proceed the next cell without changing their gloves. Protocol instructs them to bring our trays to us since a pod in our building has positive cases, but we are made us walk to the chow hall. Apparently, it saves them money because not everyone walks to get food. Yet, if they have to bring the trays to us then they have to prepare a tray for everyone in the pod. In building A pod they have positive cases and staff steadily go in and out, directly into the next pods. They are often not wearing a face mask and never wearing gloves. potentially spreading the virus. Yesterday between 9:45 AM and 10:00 AM in A.3 pod the assistant warden was walking around the pod not wearing a face mask. On 1.20.22 between 8 and 8:30AM staff conducted Covid tests to the pod without changing their gloves after handling each test. The staff here has zero regard for our health and safety. They openly make remarks about the virus not being serious and tell us we are crazy for getting an experimental vaccine. There have been so many complaints lodged against this place over the years, but it seems like it always gets swept under the rug and nothing ever happens.

Have someone ever experienced something similar?\nI am extremely curious about your advices, please do not afraid to share you thoughts with me and thanks for reading through this essay.\nPeace \u270c\ufe0f&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmbm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "sffr1n", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "focilatyo", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfimprovement/comments/sffr1n/i_feel_like_i_am_addicted_to_porn_even_though_i/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sffr1n/i_feel_like_i_am_addicted_to_porn_even_though_i/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1352066, "created_utc": 1643453617.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfimprovement", "selftext": "I heard around the internet that there is a way to actually recover faster(get back your energy) after you release your semen...anyone heard about it \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "author_fullname": "t2_8w74ebl1", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Recovery shake", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/selfimprovement", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_sed3hm", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1643329160.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.selfimprovement", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I heard around the internet that there is a way to actually recover faster(get back your energy) after you release your semen...anyone heard about it \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmbm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "sed3hm", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "gsnags", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfimprovement/comments/sed3hm/recovery_shake/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/sed3hm/recovery_shake/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1352066, "created_utc": 1643329160.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfimprovement", "selftext": " How many times did you look at somebody on social media and wished you could look that attractive as well?

Best exercise is to chew gums especially mastic gum or any other chewy and kind of hard things on the front teeth as well as both sides of your mouth for about 15 minutes daily.

If your body fat is high, it\u2019s best to cut down on the body fat as well. As the lesser amount of fat you have, the more toned and chiseled your face will look.\n* Number 5.

I don't regret it though because that's basically what kids do. At the age of 14 my eyes started to open up. Which I am very grateful for. I started to take life more seriously but I was still addicted to videogames at the time. But in the time that i wasn't playing video games i was watching motivational videos, working out and watching videos on how to be successful on youtube. At the age of 15 I've gotten more serious with my training but video games were still a problem at the time. But after a few months my console got banned and I couldn't play online anymore. That gave me a lot of free time to do other stuff. So I started watching more and more videos on success and watching more motivational videos. Now I'm 16 writing a letter trying to help most teens at my age or in their teenage years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Advice for other teenagers&lt;\n\n Listen man . you got to put in some work now. Take a bit of time off the \u201cgood life\u201d you\u2019re soon going to become an adult. When you're an adult you\u2019re going to have responsibilities, you don\u2019t want to be living with your parents for most of your 20s. You need to start looking in the future now and start learning new things. Don\u2019t be sitting in your room playing video games on discord all day. Start learning new skills, start working out, work on your mental health, learn how to invest. The younger you start learning these things the better your future life will be. That 1000$ pc won\u2019t stay with you forever. Those things are things that are going to hold you behind. Imagine the time that you're wasting on it. That time you can go outside and socialize, read a book, watch useful things on youtube. And if you think talking on discord is socializing your way over your head. Start now. Start playing less and less and start opening your eyes. We are all becoming older everyday. You don't want to be that 30 year old struggling to get by. Put in the work now so you can enjoy later. I recommend watching : hamza, 1stman, elliot hulse on youtube to get a better understanding. Don\u2019t waste your teenage years on BS. start now and enjoy later. \u201cPay the price now so you can pay any price in the future. good luck.\n\nThanks for reading this.

I don&amp;#39;t regret it though because that&amp;#39;s basically what kids do. At the age of 14 my eyes started to open up. Which I am very grateful for. I started to take life more seriously but I was still addicted to videogames at the time. But in the time that i wasn&amp;#39;t playing video games i was watching motivational videos, working out and watching videos on how to be successful on youtube. At the age of 15 I&amp;#39;ve gotten more serious with my training but video games were still a problem at the time. But after a few months my console got banned and I couldn&amp;#39;t play online anymore. That gave me a lot of free time to do other stuff. So I started watching more and more videos on success and watching more motivational videos. Now I&amp;#39;m 16 writing a letter trying to help most teens at my age or in their teenage years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Advice for other teenagers&amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Listen man . you got to put in some work now. Take a bit of time off the \u201cgood life\u201d you\u2019re soon going to become an adult. When you&amp;#39;re an adult you\u2019re going to have responsibilities, you don\u2019t want to be living with your parents for most of your 20s. You need to start looking in the future now and start learning new things. Don\u2019t be sitting in your room playing video games on discord all day. Start learning new skills, start working out, work on your mental health, learn how to invest. The younger you start learning these things the better your future life will be. That 1000$ pc won\u2019t stay with you forever. Those things are things that are going to hold you behind. Imagine the time that you&amp;#39;re wasting on it. That time you can go outside and socialize, read a book, watch useful things on youtube. And if you think talking on discord is socializing your way over your head. Start now. Start playing less and less and start opening your eyes. We are all becoming older everyday. You don&amp;#39;t want to be that 30 year old struggling to get by. Put in the work now so you can enjoy later. I recommend watching : hamza, 1stman, elliot hulse on youtube to get a better understanding. Don\u2019t waste your teenage years on BS. start now and enjoy later. \u201cPay the price now so you can pay any price in the future. good luck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading this.

Early on my wife had some atrocious anger habits as well was super pushy in bed which were huge red flags for me.\n\nThing is, as I brought up what bothered me, she basically resolved everything. She had an abusive mother whom she strives to be nothing like and consequently has developed some brilliant emotional maturity. Despite being a ball of rage, she handles and has learned to vent her anger in very positive ways. Throughout the marriage she has had her moments, which I immediately posted in my head as \"Oh shit, this isn't happening is it?\" but she always cleans up her behavior and apologizes afterwards if she feels she went to far. (Which is almost always, so good on her.)\n\nAs for intimacy, I very strongly clarified that no meant no, and she eventually understood. In that regard she literally never was taught \"no means no\" so when I finally made this point she felt terrible and respected that boundary religiously from then on. Apparently her parents never taught her that. (One was in prison for most her life, leaving the abusive mother.) But this was after I had already had a generally negative experience in bed, feeling slightly violated. This was quite some time ago.\n\nI like to do things and strive for things. I improve myself and build stuff. My wife finds this inspiring as she has never considered \"improving herself\" as an option. She is excited about this and is trying it all herself. I don't push any of this at all, as I feel if It was my doing any changes wouldn't be genuine.\n\nSo basically her parents didn't rear her at all, and I feel like I'm raising her myself in a way. I love her to death, but it's a bit disconcerting.\n\nTo top this off, I got married to this girl while I still had strong feelings for another woman. I was young and didn't realize that you CAN'T get over past relationships by creating new ones. I thought that was how moving on worked etc etc. I was dumb. It's been years and the mark this other girl left on my life has torn me apart. This has gotten much better and I've gotten my feelings such that I can finally move on in my life, but the damage dealt has been dealt.\n\nOh and in order to marry her, I moved back to my hometown, ditched all my friends, the college I was going to attend, and everything else I cared about. Boo hoo, wo is me. I've gotten over it, but it hurt a lot for a long time.\n\nTo sum all this up, or TLDR; I've felt like I'm settling... like this whole time. At this point my wife does virtually no evil. Every issue I has is literally because *she isn't good enough and life was better in my old town with betty etc*. It makes me feel very selfish. I may even be selfish. Dunno.\n\nBut we have a kid. 6 month old. I will not leave this kid. I love her will all my being, and despite my wifes failings, I personally believe no other woman could raise her like my wife. I wouldn't take her away from her mother and I wouldn't leave her. So... yeah.\n\nSo i'm thinking like... maybe a \"parenting marriage?\" I dunno. I've had these moments throughout the marriage where I'm suddenly lucid and feeling like I've ruined my life and this isn't where I want to be. I want to get away so badly, but I want to be there for my daughter. And at the same time I really do love my wife and wonder if maybe we could turn our lives around in a more desirable direction.\n\nIdk. I've had some \\*wish I was dead\\* thoughts for the first time in my life which really scared me. Told her, and she got mad at me for being selfish.

I've worked really hard on this the last years and I've changed it. I became much more confident, an extrovert, very charismatic and talkative. You can throw me in any group of people and I'd be comfortable. Complete opposite of what I used to be. \n\nI'm so proud of that, however, I've still stayed somewhat soft and emotional and I don't like that. I was raised only by my mom and I think that played a big role. I'm not that strong also. You know, I was never bullied or something, I was always on the side. I was always friends with the bullies in school but never bullied anyone. I've always stayed by my side. I don't know how to put someone down. I remember always thinking I'm smarter than everyone cause I just stay by my side and never cause any problems or get involved. Now I see how that was a problem.

I&amp;#39;ve worked really hard on this the last years and I&amp;#39;ve changed it. I became much more confident, an extrovert, very charismatic and talkative. You can throw me in any group of people and I&amp;#39;d be comfortable. Complete opposite of what I used to be. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so proud of that, however, I&amp;#39;ve still stayed somewhat soft and emotional and I don&amp;#39;t like that. I was raised only by my mom and I think that played a big role. I&amp;#39;m not that strong also. You know, I was never bullied or something, I was always on the side. I was always friends with the bullies in school but never bullied anyone. I&amp;#39;ve always stayed by my side. I don&amp;#39;t know how to put someone down. I remember always thinking I&amp;#39;m smarter than everyone cause I just stay by my side and never cause any problems or get involved. Now I see how that was a problem.

The first step toward becoming wealthy is to train your subconscious mind to attract wealth. The first step is to create wealthy thoughts in your mind. Then, secondly, turn those thoughts into actions that result in a prosperous reality.  \nMoney will naturally come into your life if you can learn to discipline your mind to make the right decisions.  \nIt should come as no surprise that manifesting money is one of the most common goals that people have. Most of us would like more money, even if we don't necessarily need it. Having a little extra money would be nice. With the right mindset, it is possible to train the subconscious mind to attract wealth.  \nIt all comes down to mindset. Every day, we are bombarded with advertisements and images of wealthy and beautiful people, which frequently portray that if we had more money, we would be more attractive. Of course, this is not true, but it is amazing what the power of advertising can accomplish.  \nSo, Let us get started.  \nThe truth about creating wealth is as follows: first, create thoughts that have enormous value in the world. Then, simply add action to your thoughts to make those valuable thoughts a reality.  \nLet us take a look at four simple steps that will help you gain wealth through your subconscious mind.  \n\n\nHere are four steps to help you in attracting wealth through your subconscious mind:  \nStep #1: Learn to Master Yourself  \nIf you want to make money, the most important thing you should do is figure out who you are:  \nNobody should be able to get you to perform better than you.  \nStop considering your job to be the most important role in your life. Your job does not define who you are. Your job exists so that you can earn money to assist you in finding yourself. Your job title should serve to supplement your journey of discovering who you are, not to define who you are.  \nBegin to regard your life as your most important job. Set out on a mission to discover who you truly are, and challenge yourself on a daily basis with the following questions: What exactly am I? What am I doing here? What causes me to be sad? What gives me a sense of aliveness? What drives me to squander money? What makes me want to save money?  \nThe first step toward mastering your life is becoming aware of who you are and who you want to be.  \nPause for a moment. Take a look around you. Your current life is a training ground for you to become who you're meant to be. What exactly should you be doing right now? Now put that thought into action and start doing those things! This is how you transform into a warrior in your life. You should aspire to be a warrior because warriors are the rare individuals who achieve their goals.  \nBegin thinking deeply about who, why, what, and how you're here at all times. Look for hints as to why you were put on this planet. Self-mastery is the first step toward mastering everything else in your life.  \nSecret #2:\u00a0 Understand Your Environment  \nOnce you've mastered yourself, turn your attention to the external environments in which you live and begin mastering them as well. Ask yourself, \"Are your external environments assisting you in finding the life you seek?\" Or are they stifling you?  \n   \nSuccessful people do not achieve success on their own. They are successful because they have support groups of friends who help them achieve their goals. Wealthy people are constantly asking themselves, \"Am I immersed in unique environments that will naturally push me toward my goals and dreams?\" Or are my surroundings hurting my chances of achieving my life goals?  \nIf you're stuck in bad situations and are unwilling to change, just accept that you're probably screwed and will not succeed in life. Hopefully, that harsh reality motivates you to get up and start looking for better environments that will help you succeed.  \nA great wealth-building tip is to always be willing to trade your current comfort for the opportunity to work for a better future. You've got this. Anyone can do it. However, in order to change your life's future, you must be willing to endure the short-term pain of change.  \nStep #3:\u00a0 Start Solving Your Problems  \nOne of the most serious issues in modern society, in my opinion, is that everyone is waiting for someone else to tell them what to do with their lives.  \nThis, is why I believe most people in our society find contentment and wealth in their careers. The majority of people are waiting for someone else to tell them what to do, rather than listening to their souls and embarking on an adventure to solve their own problems.  \nThis issue is most likely the result of how most of us were raised in our public education. Let us take an example  \nWe are trained to do what we are told for 12 years in public school. We go to school and wait for our teachers to instruct us on what we should do. Then we go to work and wait for our managers to tell us what we should do. We become so conditioned to wait for others to tell us what to do that we stop taking action to live out what our souls want us to do with our lives.  \nIf you want to train your subconscious mind to attract wealth, you must break free from this linear, controlled way of thinking. You can do this by taking passionate ownership of the aspects of life that you enjoy and rebelling against the aspects of life that your soul despises. Listen to your soul to discover which aspects of life you enjoy, and then go out and make more opportunities for yourself to do so!  \nIf necessary, outsource everything else. Stop relying on others to show you the way! Become a leader and take risks in order to live the life you desire!  \nReprogram everything you've been told, and you'll be able to do the things you want to do with confidence. This is how you rise to the position of leader. Stop paying attention to what everyone else is doing. Separate each problem and then set out on a mission to solve each one. If you can do this, you can have wealth, happiness, and independence.  \nStep #4: Money Buys Freedom. Purpose Generates Wealth  \nThere is a huge population of \"rich\" people out there who have a lot of money but they are not happy with life.\u00a0 I will tell you right now that this is not the life you are looking for.  \nYou desire a life in which your money, purpose, and talent dance in unison on a daily basis. This is how people become really cool, unique, and enjoyable to be around. This is also how they train their subconscious to attract money with their minds. Add a few frugal living tips and knowledge on how to spend money wisely, and you can start creating your own unique style of wealth regardless of how much money you make.  \nConsider your life's purpose as another human being looking for you. However, when you become sluggish, your purpose becomes sluggish as well and stops looking for you. When you lose awareness, your purpose loses awareness as well. When you give up, your purpose does as well.  \nYour purpose, on the other hand, becomes energized when you become energized. When you move faster toward your goals, your purpose follows suit. When you discover yourself, you will discover your purpose. Devote your life to first mastering yourself. Second, work on making your surroundings better. Third, by resolving your life's problems, you will unconsciously discover your life's purpose. This is how you train your subconscious mind to attract wealth, and these are the steps you need to take to get started.  \nHow to Bring Wealth and Abundance into Your Life  \nWhen you open your mind to abundance, you open it to wealth as well. Before you can do that, you must first identify the source of any negatives or obstacles. It's almost certainly based on your previous experiences or what you've learned along the way. These erroneous beliefs must be dispelled before you can begin to attract wealth and abundance. The first step is to change your beliefs and attitude toward attraction.  \nYou should align your thoughts with the desired outcome or goal. If thoughts are held and repeated, they will eventually become beliefs. That is why you should think about the outcome as if you have already achieved it. If you accept that we are, at our most basic level, made up of energy and vibrations, you'll realize that our thoughts are also vibrations. If you also accept the vibrations we send out, attract similar vibration, you\u2019ll see why they need to be high or positive vibrations.  \nIt is nearly impossible to think positively and with high vibrational thoughts all of the time. It does become easier with practice, in the same way that running a longer distance becomes easier as we practice. The best way to do this is to constantly monitor your thoughts. Bring them back to the positive when they begin to stray. When you think negatively, your vibration shifts away from your goal, so changing your thoughts to positive ones brings you back into alignment. It's not always easy, but it's certainly doable, and with time and practice, you'll notice a difference. This is how you organize your mind to attract wealth.  \nConclusion  \nWhile it is possible to learn how to attract wealth quickly, it usually requires time and practice. You must cultivate a new mindset, one in which you believe you deserve it and believe it has already occurred. Remember, it's not the feelings you get from this that get the results; it's you.  \nYou're conditioning your mind to accept a different reality. It will motivate you to make changes and take the steps necessary to move forward. Set your intentions so that you are completely clear on the outcome. As your attitude and actions change, you will find yourself in new situations and new opportunities. You make this happen; it's your path, so make it whatever you want it to be.  \nIt's also important to be happy, so engage in activities that make you feel that way. When you're in a good mood, it's easier to make the right decisions. This is critical to getting the results you want. Don't dwell on past mistakes; instead, learn from them and move on. It is likely that training the subconscious mind to attract money will be a slow process. Take it one step at a time, don't get too worked up about setbacks, just correct them and keep moving forward.", "author_fullname": "t2_cu2qx6nh", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How to train your mind for wealth NO B.S.

The first step toward becoming wealthy is to train your subconscious mind to attract wealth. The first step is to create wealthy thoughts in your mind. Then, secondly, turn those thoughts into actions that result in a prosperous reality.&lt;br/&gt;\nMoney will naturally come into your life if you can learn to discipline your mind to make the right decisions.&lt;br/&gt;\nIt should come as no surprise that manifesting money is one of the most common goals that people have. Most of us would like more money, even if we don&amp;#39;t necessarily need it. Having a little extra money would be nice. With the right mindset, it is possible to train the subconscious mind to attract wealth.&lt;br/&gt;\nIt all comes down to mindset. Every day, we are bombarded with advertisements and images of wealthy and beautiful people, which frequently portray that if we had more money, we would be more attractive. Of course, this is not true, but it is amazing what the power of advertising can accomplish.&lt;br/&gt;\nSo, Let us get started.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe truth about creating wealth is as follows: first, create thoughts that have enormous value in the world. Then, simply add action to your thoughts to make those valuable thoughts a reality.&lt;br/&gt;\nLet us take a look at four simple steps that will help you gain wealth through your subconscious mind.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are four steps to help you in attracting wealth through your subconscious mind:&lt;br/&gt;\nStep #1: Learn to Master Yourself&lt;br/&gt;\nIf you want to make money, the most important thing you should do is figure out who you are:&lt;br/&gt;\nNobody should be able to get you to perform better than you.&lt;br/&gt;\nStop considering your job to be the most important role in your life. Your job does not define who you are. Your job exists so that you can earn money to assist you in finding yourself. Your job title should serve to supplement your journey of discovering who you are, not to define who you are.&lt;br/&gt;\nBegin to regard your life as your most important job. Set out on a mission to discover who you truly are, and challenge yourself on a daily basis with the following questions: What exactly am I? What am I doing here? What causes me to be sad? What gives me a sense of aliveness? What drives me to squander money? What makes me want to save money?&lt;br/&gt;\nThe first step toward mastering your life is becoming aware of who you are and who you want to be.&lt;br/&gt;\nPause for a moment. Take a look around you. Your current life is a training ground for you to become who you&amp;#39;re meant to be. What exactly should you be doing right now? Now put that thought into action and start doing those things! This is how you transform into a warrior in your life. You should aspire to be a warrior because warriors are the rare individuals who achieve their goals.&lt;br/&gt;\nBegin thinking deeply about who, why, what, and how you&amp;#39;re here at all times. Look for hints as to why you were put on this planet. Self-mastery is the first step toward mastering everything else in your life.&lt;br/&gt;\nSecret #2:\u00a0 Understand Your Environment&lt;br/&gt;\nOnce you&amp;#39;ve mastered yourself, turn your attention to the external environments in which you live and begin mastering them as well. Ask yourself, &amp;quot;Are your external environments assisting you in finding the life you seek?&amp;quot; Or are they stifling you?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Successful people do not achieve success on their own. They are successful because they have support groups of friends who help them achieve their goals. Wealthy people are constantly asking themselves, &amp;quot;Am I immersed in unique environments that will naturally push me toward my goals and dreams?&amp;quot; Or are my surroundings hurting my chances of achieving my life goals?&lt;br/&gt;\nIf you&amp;#39;re stuck in bad situations and are unwilling to change, just accept that you&amp;#39;re probably screwed and will not succeed in life. Hopefully, that harsh reality motivates you to get up and start looking for better environments that will help you succeed.&lt;br/&gt;\nA great wealth-building tip is to always be willing to trade your current comfort for the opportunity to work for a better future. You&amp;#39;ve got this. Anyone can do it. However, in order to change your life&amp;#39;s future, you must be willing to endure the short-term pain of change.&lt;br/&gt;\nStep #3:\u00a0 Start Solving Your Problems&lt;br/&gt;\nOne of the most serious issues in modern society, in my opinion, is that everyone is waiting for someone else to tell them what to do with their lives.&lt;br/&gt;\nThis, is why I believe most people in our society find contentment and wealth in their careers.

This was our very first holiday outside the country so we were incredibly excited.\n\nOne night me and my mom were at the bar relaxing and my mom had a couple of drinks. I told her I was cold and tired as it was midnight so I went to the room to relax. After about 20 minutes my aunt texts me telling me to check on her.\n\nI go back and see her at the bar at a table with two men talking. They both seemed friendly and I talked to them for a bit after being assured that my mom was in a safe environment with safe people. I asked my mom if it was okay if I went back to the room.\n\nI went back to the room and texted my aunt she's with two men that seem nice. My aunt tells me to quickly go back and get my mom back to the room as it's dangerous and something could happen, I go back, and my mom is gone, so are the men.\n\nI start freaking out and I begin to search all over the resort for her. The beach, the dining room, every single corner of the hotel, I asked staff members. At this point I'm tearing up knowing my mom is drunk, and probably being raped. I'm scared, and I don't know what to do. No one knows where she is. All I can do is keep looking as I do not want to believe something bad is happening to my mom.\n\nAfter searching for 30 minutes, my brother texts me telling me she's back at the room. I run back to the room and she's crying in pain on the floor screaming she got raped. I'm completely scared and fuming in waves of anger and sadness. Something I've never experience before, this was different compared to the normal sensation of helplessness and depression, it was worse.\n\nI'm hoping this is the alcohol talking, I'm hoping next morning, everything will be okay, and it was not true. We go to reception and tell the workers what happened, they call the manager, we give them info and they say we will get back to us next morning, we go to our room, my mom goes sleep however I am kept up almost the whole night, in shock of what happened.\n\nNext morning I find out it's true. I feel depressed, and scared, angry that I didn't stop this from happening and I just couldn't believe it. This happened because of me, I could've prevented it. I should've known my mom was drunk and with 2 unknown men. I just thought it was a safe place. How stupid could I be!?\n\nWe have to go to the police, write a statement and go through the whole process, my mom is sad and is in a clear state of sadness, apologising to me about this situation when it should be me begging for her forgiveness. No evidence is found against the man. He is put in jail however when we are back home in our country we find out he was released after. I'm helpless.\n\nNothing happened to the man, he gets away with it. I can just imagine what my mom feels. I've had fantasies of murdering this man and torturing him for what he's done.\n\nOur first holiday which was supposed to be the greatest time of our life was ruined, my mom was raped because of me. It's been months since this happened and I think about it every night. Ever since we left we haven't spoken about the holiday, or about the situation. We haven't even spoken about the good things, because it will always lead us to remember what happened.\n\nThe whole thing is awkward to talk about and I still am in shock that such thing happened. I can't help but think about this most days. My mom seems fine and I hope she is. I just can't get over this, my duty is to protect my mom and I failed. I not only failed my mom but myself, as the oldest son, as the man of the house, to protect my mother.

I&amp;#39;m scared, and I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. No one knows where she is. All I can do is keep looking as I do not want to believe something bad is happening to my mom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After searching for 30 minutes, my brother texts me telling me she&amp;#39;s back at the room. I run back to the room and she&amp;#39;s crying in pain on the floor screaming she got raped. I&amp;#39;m completely scared and fuming in waves of anger and sadness. Something I&amp;#39;ve never experience before, this was different compared to the normal sensation of helplessness and depression, it was worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m hoping this is the alcohol talking, I&amp;#39;m hoping next morning, everything will be okay, and it was not true. We go to reception and tell the workers what happened, they call the manager, we give them info and they say we will get back to us next morning, we go to our room, my mom goes sleep however I am kept up almost the whole night, in shock of what happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next morning I find out it&amp;#39;s true. I feel depressed, and scared, angry that I didn&amp;#39;t stop this from happening and I just couldn&amp;#39;t believe it. This happened because of me, I could&amp;#39;ve prevented it. I should&amp;#39;ve known my mom was drunk and with 2 unknown men. I just thought it was a safe place. How stupid could I be!?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have to go to the police, write a statement and go through the whole process, my mom is sad and is in a clear state of sadness, apologising to me about this situation when it should be me begging for her forgiveness. No evidence is found against the man. He is put in jail however when we are back home in our country we find out he was released after. I&amp;#39;m helpless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing happened to the man, he gets away with it. I can just imagine what my mom feels. I&amp;#39;ve had fantasies of murdering this man and torturing him for what he&amp;#39;s done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our first holiday which was supposed to be the greatest time of our life was ruined, my mom was raped because of me. It&amp;#39;s been months since this happened and I think about it every night. Ever since we left we haven&amp;#39;t spoken about the holiday, or about the situation. We haven&amp;#39;t even spoken about the good things, because it will always lead us to remember what happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whole thing is awkward to talk about and I still am in shock that such thing happened. I can&amp;#39;t help but think about this most days. My mom seems fine and I hope she is. I just can&amp;#39;t get over this, my duty is to protect my mom and I failed. I not only failed my mom but myself, as the oldest son, as the man of the house, to protect my mother. I have failed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "1bea587e-1e98-11ed-a645-26150c9d6f11", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmbm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#ff4500", "id": "zcoabr", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CallMeMcLovin-", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 169, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfimprovement/comments/zcoabr/my_mom_was_raped_because_of_me/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/zcoabr/my_mom_was_raped_because_of_me/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1352066, "created_utc": 1670193622.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfimprovement", "selftext": "A lot of us don\u2019t realize that you we are internally, genuinely messed up.

If you are, please do not read it.** It is not my intention to spark any controversy, or look like an insensitive asshole. I simply want to know if anyone else experienced what I'm experiencing and ask for help.\n\nSo: I have a very good remote job. My pay is about 3x the average in my home country (Italy), and I started working with American clients when I was 18. My first job online was as a blogger when I was 14, and I was making pennies per month. At 18, I was making a standard salary in Italy by teaching digital marketing to people looking to improve their careers (paid by the gov), and at 19 I was making $2 per hour working for a web agency.\n\nWhile making that amount of money, everyone loved me. They hung out with me, wanted to know me better, and ask for advice.\n\nAfter 5 years, though, my career skyrocketed. I never forced my clients to pay me better, I never even hired a single employee and paid all freelancers I worked with well above average in their home country (usually, even more than I paid myself), but no matter what I do, I'm always a rich bastard.\n\nI'm in the position the vast majority of people want to be in... I get it. But I never stole from anyone. I always tell every single soul that DMs me how I did it. I try to cheer them up, and redirect to useful, and usually free, information on how to acquire high-paying skills in the tech world, where wages are higher and work/life balance is a real thing. But they don't listen, and instead, blame me for their misfortune all the time.\n\nLook, I get it. I know people that are really struggling. The world is not fair. What I make, just like anyone else with a good job, is not fair. I'm not bragging or wanting to be considered superior in any shape or form.\n\nBut how can \"wanting a better life for all\", and \"achieving a good life\" both be bad things? Everyone insulting me now (even in my own friends' group) would go on holiday every 2 days if they were in my position. While I didn't take a single paid holiday in 7 years. How can everything be wrong? being in a good job, and wanting a good job?

If you are, please do not read it.&lt;/strong&gt; It is not my intention to spark any controversy, or look like an insensitive asshole. I simply want to know if anyone else experienced what I&amp;#39;m experiencing and ask for help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So: I have a very good remote job. My pay is about 3x the average in my home country (Italy), and I started working with American clients when I was 18. My first job online was as a blogger when I was 14, and I was making pennies per month. At 18, I was making a standard salary in Italy by teaching digital marketing to people looking to improve their careers (paid by the gov), and at 19 I was making $2 per hour working for a web agency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While making that amount of money, everyone loved me. They hung out with me, wanted to know me better, and ask for advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After 5 years, though, my career skyrocketed. I never forced my clients to pay me better, I never even hired a single employee and paid all freelancers I worked with well above average in their home country (usually, even more than I paid myself), but no matter what I do, I&amp;#39;m always a rich bastard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m in the position the vast majority of people want to be in... I get it. But I never stole from anyone. I always tell every single soul that DMs me how I did it. I try to cheer them up, and redirect to useful, and usually free, information on how to acquire high-paying skills in the tech world, where wages are higher and work/life balance is a real thing. But they don&amp;#39;t listen, and instead, blame me for their misfortune all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look, I get it. I know people that are really struggling. The world is not fair. What I make, just like anyone else with a good job, is not fair. I&amp;#39;m not bragging or wanting to be considered superior in any shape or form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But how can &amp;quot;wanting a better life for all&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;achieving a good life&amp;quot; both be bad things? Everyone insulting me now (even in my own friends&amp;#39; group) would go on holiday every 2 days if they were in my position. While I didn&amp;#39;t take a single paid holiday in 7 years. How can everything be wrong? being in a good job, and wanting a good job? It just seems odd to me, and like I can never make peace with myself and with my current situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My clients didn&amp;#39;t fall from the sky. They can also all fire me at a second&amp;#39;s notice, I&amp;#39;m not an employee and my contracts are incredibly short and to the point. I only work if they like my output.

It\u2019s making enough money so that you have an emergency fund that could provide your family with money if something were to happen. It\u2019s having a family and spending quality time with them. Having a loving wife and kids that look up to you and are grateful for what you do every day for them. It\u2019s having a small group of real friends with whom you can spend real quality time.

And it is not achieved by playing video games all night long or by eating unhealthy food. It won\u2019t be easy, like all things, but you sure have what it takes to make it, trust me. It\u2019s all about mindset. Imagine yourself at a high level of success, see yourself having achieved every single goal that you have put before yourself. Close your eyes and think, what is the next goal you want to achieve in life, is it getting that degree, starting to make money on your business ? Whatever the goal is, go on, close your eyes and see yourself with that degree in your hand, seeing that first $100 gained from your own business. I dare you, close your eyes and do it before reading the next paragraph.\n\nNow that you probably smiled while your eyes were closed and you feel motivated, let\u2019s learn about what you just did, visualization. Visualization is a technique I learned from the Youtuber Hamza. It\u2019s a technique where you simply imagine yourself, after having achieved your goal. The happiness that it would bring you and the sensation of fullfilment. But that technique will be discussed in another post.

And it is not achieved by playing video games all night long or by eating unhealthy food. It won\u2019t be easy, like all things, but you sure have what it takes to make it, trust me. It\u2019s all about mindset. Imagine yourself at a high level of success, see yourself having achieved every single goal that you have put before yourself. Close your eyes and think, what is the next goal you want to achieve in life, is it getting that degree, starting to make money on your business ? Whatever the goal is, go on, close your eyes and see yourself with that degree in your hand, seeing that first $100 gained from your own business. I dare you, close your eyes and do it before reading the next paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that you probably smiled while your eyes were closed and you feel motivated, let\u2019s learn about what you just did, visualization. Visualization is a technique I learned from the Youtuber Hamza. It\u2019s a technique where you simply imagine yourself, after having achieved your goal. The happiness that it would bring you and the sensation of fullfilment. But that technique will be discussed in another post. Share that post with a friend or someone who needs it and don\u2019t forget to follow to never miss any posts. Keep grinding, whatever the obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmbm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "ug8f7x", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 7, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/selfimprovement/comments/ug8f7x/you_probably_are_in_the_99_of_unsuccessful_men/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/ug8f7x/you_probably_are_in_the_99_of_unsuccessful_men/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1352066, "created_utc": 1651436345.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfimprovement", "selftext": "This is more an outburst, but maybe this can provoke some self-reflection on you guys, or maybe some of you can help me to lead with this. \n\nI have 15 years old, and I am in this journey of self improvement a good time.\n\nRecently, some events made me think about some things.

With that out the way, let's begin.\n\nA common symptom experienced by men who are sexually unsuccessful is extreme envy coupled with despair when they see a beautiful woman. Elliot Rodger frequently reported being driven insane by the sight of happy couples. Now that is an extreme example, but if he had perhaps tried to address the root cause of that emotion and work on it, or if someone else had, he wouldn't have done what he did. Now, I have had romantic success throughout my life. Not with as many women as I'd like and not right now, but I remind myself that it's a never ending chasm that will never be filled no matter how many women you sleep with. However, I still experience that...feeling, when confronted with a woman who I find beautiful. That crushing thought of her getting with other men, the feeling that she wouldn't like me. And it gets even darker than that. I am tormented by the thought of a woman I loved two years ago sleeping with other men (which she has) and sometimes it sends my brain into a negative feedback loop and I start to become very uncomfortable and agitated at the thought of other men enjoying what I could never get. There's no thought process that I can adopt that eases the burden of this knowledge. I just have to go day by day living with it. \n\nIt's like being at a party and seeing your crush hooking up with someone on the dance floor, but almost with every woman I meet. Now I know I'm not alone in this, and that it's standard symptoms of desperation, but I don't get how some guys who are way less experienced than me are not driven mad by the world of sex going on out there just because it doesn't involve them for a few months. It's ridiculous and it's taking a massive toll on my mental health. Now, I think that I am aware of the root cause of this issue; low self esteem due to lots of trauma and neglect in my early life. I project onto women in the world to give me the love I didn't receive as a child. Maybe, I'm not entirely sure. I do therapy, but I never really seem to make any emotional breakthroughs. We uncover potential reasons, but my psychological and physiological reactions are exactly the same as  the first day I went in there. I haven't learned any strategies to help pull me out of negative feedback loops, and I just have to cope with them day after day. \n\nSo my question to the men is, have any of you struggled with these emotions? Have you overcome them? And How?\n\nThank you.", "author_fullname": "t2_pv6mv0us", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Is there a name for that lustful envy that men experience when they see a good looking woman and is there a way to get rid of it?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/selfimprovement", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_zo5hy0", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 93, "total_awards_received": 1, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Question", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 93, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "nsfw", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1671280833.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 3, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.selfimprovement", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, this is self improvement related because I experience this and I want to get rid of it.

I could go on but I feel that I'm near everything I want but I can never reach it.\n\nAnd yes I procrastinate, I'm human and not perfect but I feel like I can never be truly good at anything, I can always be average.

However my doctor believes I am here is why,\n\n**Story time**\n\nWhen I was in grade 7 I had a crush on a girl, her name was Pam. I tried to get closer to her but she kept going for other guys. Good looking dress nice I didn't come from a home that had money. Every year a new girl a new crush and I had very... poor social life. I wasn't really invited out to a lot of things by other kids. I only socialized at school and I never did any sports as a kid (I had really really bad asthma that would flare up and often times put me in the doctors office or emergency.)\n\nHighschool... same story. I had a circle of friends however and I did go to parties and socialize but I was often teased for being a virgin. (I hated the fact I was 16-18 and a virgin still.)\n\nCollege.. Never met anyone not a lot of women in my field (I.T.)\n\nFinally I met a girl through a new circle of friends I had and she actually wanted to date me. She was my first love. I really loved this girl and it was great to start and I finally got to do all the things I always wanted to with someone.\n\n* Cuddle and watch movies\n\n* Surprise her with gifts\n\n* Go to cool and interesting restaurants and bars\n\n* Go camping\n\n* Find new interests and share mine with her\n\n* Be intimate with someone (I can also say this being with someone for a longish term and being comfortable with them and them with you makes for a great sex life.)\n\nWe ended up splitting up because she cheated on me.\n\n****************************************************\n\nNext girl I met was 2 years later. I was working she was a co worker. We were good friends and she was engaged. So while I was attracted to her I would never be \"that\" guy. (home wrecker). Her and him were high school sweethearts. They were together for many years and had recently bought a house together.\n\n**He got married just before Christmas to his co-worker, mistress, other girlfriend.**\n\nShe was 100 percent crushed. She reached out to me and told me what happened I was really concerned she would do something to herself. I went to her and was a friend. I listened to her I was her shoulder to cry on and I made no moves **AT ALL**. She was upset she had no plans for new years. So I met up with her we had dinner went for a few drinks and then watched the fireworks. I drove her home and the next day she called me asking if I would like to go for a coffee and hang out. I picked her up we grabbed a coffee sat in my truck and then she came across the bench seat I had and started making out with me. (this was about 1 month post break up)\n\nAnd we just kept doing this every night almost like teenagers. We started dating I was sleeping over at her place. \n\nAnd then one day on the way to her house She asked me to order pizza and my phone was dead. She gave me hers and as soon as I opened the safari app. Her history was up and I remember exactly what it said \"How do you break it off with your rebound.\"\n\n********************************************\n\nI had a few one night stands at this point. I was tired of getting depressed and hating life. So I just wanted to sleep with whomever. (also at this time I was living on my own out of my parents place I had bought a condo.)\n\nEveryonce in awhile I would try and find a long term relationship because as Wilt Chamberlain said.\n\n*\u201cHaving a thousand different ladies is pretty cool, I've learned in my life. I've found out that having one woman a thousand different times is more satisfying.\u201d* - Wilt Chamberlain\n\n***********************************************************\n\nIts been 10 years since that last relationship. I am looking down the barrel of being 35 in 6 months.\n\nNow where does the self hate come in?\n\n* I hate that I can be on every dating app and exhaust the entire dating pool and not find one woman into me.\n\n* I hate that women don't look at me and find me attractive.\n\n* I hate that everyone I know is past this stage in their life and has families.\n\n* I hate that I couldn't keep up and now I had many friendships grow apart because... I am the single friend.\n\n* I hate that I have nothing to do on weekends and all I do is wait for Monday.\n\n* I hate that I have no highlights of my own to post on social media. (I am not any social media anymore. I don't consider reddit social media like Facebook.)\n\nNow... I know what you're going to say \"Online dating is terrible for the majority of users meet people in real life.\" I wish I knew how. I have gotten involved with coed sports. I am my teams captain. But... no one is interested in socializing outside of the game itself.\n\nSo I am trying. I am trying to meet people. \n\n***********************************************\n\nSo, the reason I hate myself is because the very basic thing of meeting someone, dating, I struggle so hard with. I hate that I am not attractive its the ultimate ice breaker. I've even used apps that don't show your face to meet people and then exchange pics and every time \"You're not my type.\" Fine you don't like me its cool you're not my first rejection you're not my last.\n\nIts been 10 years.\n\nAnd.. I finally sat down with my doctor and I told her this.\n\n\"The only reason I am on this earth still at this point. Is I don't want to put my parents through that heartache. However... the moment they are gone I got my affairs in order and I will end my life.\" ( I am not suicidal however I don't see an end and at this point I feel time has ran out.)\n\nShe put me on Wellbutrin and I have been taking it for a month now. (I am not depressed and I have not felt any different from when I started taking it other than insomnia)\n\nShe also said I should see a psychologist. Which I am doing. \n\nToday my psychologist told me I need to love myself before I love anyone else. I flat out told her that its never going to happen. I hate myself because of my situation.\n\n*********************************************************\n\nI don't know what to do, I really was hoping to be married at least by now maybe starting a family. Instead... I am just going to work coming home. falling asleep at some point and repeating. That is all my life is. I enjoy Friday because I get time off but even now I am like \"Why do I care having time off there is nothing to do.\"\n\nAnyway when I left my psychologists office today she asked me to do 3 things.\n\n* Tell myself every day. \"I matter, I have worth, I deserve it.\"\n\n* Write down 5 things I do really well.\n\n* Find a hobby and get into it.\n\nI told her I find CBT very patronizing and hokey. My issue isn't my mindset. My issue is not me thinking I am not worthy. My issue is I cannot look at myself in the mirror without hating what I see. This ugly guy looking back at me that no one wants. I am tired of waking up and just being this worker drone. I hate coming home to an empty house. I hate not having a purpose.\n\nI hate myself because I can't change the situation I am. I am not attractive and that can't be changed. ( you can say get into a gym, an all that but I have an ugly face.)\n\nI wish that people who are like me could just be euthanized and that it would be socially acceptable. I don't want to wake up anymore. Time has ran out on everything I wanted to achieve.\n\nAnyway.

They then invited me to go to a bar with them... I can drink when needed so I did just that.. but there's this wife of my boss who's very hell bent on wanting me to dev\\*rginize myself and look for a man that will do it to me. It was never my thing because all I knew, was that the only reason we were in the bar was to just meet my work team and to socialize, not to do the things she/they wanted me to do... That said wife was never part of my social circle, she was there because she's the wife of my boss. But for some reason, that person keeps on making fun of me because of being me.

If so, how do i keep going?\n\nSometimes it feels like there's two people here, and IM always in the backseat, watching as all these horrible life decisions are being made by this undesirable person i call Rash.

He has Aspergers, and is already living healthily, he eats clean, exercises regularly and even has a job as an apprentice in the construction company down the road. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I battle to brush my teeth on the regular, i don&amp;#39;t eat clean. In fact, i cant control my emotions very well (something i also am trying to work on) and have noticed that everytime I&amp;#39;m upset, i automatically have this craving for sugar. I always give in. I don&amp;#39;t eat clean, i don&amp;#39;t exercise regularly. I don&amp;#39;t look after my body at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I noticed i also have the habit of falling into my victim mentality .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve dumbed it all down to low confidence and low self esteem. And i know the way forward is to start doing the things that define the person i want to be. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its hell. And i need help, because I&amp;#39;m so tired of being this huge steaming pile of disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I even did some research and thought i may have ADHD. But my mom is EXTREMELY sure there&amp;#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with me. Im unemployed, and live in an area where therapy is not an option, so i cant even get tested. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know where to start. I&amp;#39;ve tried so many things. What am i doing wrong? Have i lived in my comfort zone for too long, and is this struggle a good thing? Must i just keep pushing forward? If so, how do i keep going?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it feels like there&amp;#39;s two people here, and IM always in the backseat, watching as all these horrible life decisions are being made by this undesirable person i call Rash. (Makes it easier to ignore intrusive thoughts if i give this negative voice some physical attributes, learned this from Jim Kwik).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am I being dramatic? Is it really all that simple? What does it take to get my life together? Im so stuck. And I&amp;#39;m so, so tired of making mistakes that keep hurting the people i love.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "298cd47c-1e96-11ed-bd72-fe7bc3f1a69c", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmbm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#94e044", "id": "x8b6j2", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Glad-os03", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 12, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfimprovement/comments/x8b6j2/my_life_is_a_mess/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/x8b6j2/my_life_is_a_mess/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1352066, "created_utc": 1662571955.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfimprovement", "selftext": "I am 20 and I just finished high school,and I am unsure about what I want to do in the future and my relationship is pretty going into ruins.\n\nI have a friend that from my perspective has everythinf figured out,he knows what he will do in life and his girlfriend makes time for him and prioritizes him,he is the one with more \"power\" in the relationship,while in my relationship I seem like the one who is respected less. \nI would like to be like him a bit and have my life figured out and be confident. \nHow can I possibly do this?

Because constant resistance to stuff makes you stressed and tired, which makes your willpower weak.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When I am outside I will always have a bottle of water with me, and things like that.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I wrote in my notebook, the state I want to defeat and transform it into (which I believe is always powerful) Added Sugar/eating unhealthy----------------------------&amp;gt;Real Sugar/Eating healthy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I knew that because it&amp;#39;s so addictive I can break this habit only if I am radical, and not little by little. So I did it radically!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I failed and relapsed before, and this is what helped me to grow and understand how not to fail this time. + When I tried and failed before, it helped me lower my sugar consumption.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There are healthy shops near me, so if I want something like a cookie, I will buy the &amp;quot;healthy&amp;quot; ones without added sugar (they are more expensive and they don&amp;#39;t taste as good as the sugar ones, but they are still better than bread)(no disrespect to bread tho)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Avoided alcohol (this will be another topic)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I believed it can be done...

I did love her and always will, I\u2019m just not heterosexual. Growing up in the south and the \u201cBible belt\u201d gay is only talked about in a negative manner. We started dating in 2013, married in 2018, and separated/divorced in July 2019. I left the marriage because I knew I was gay, I have always known but in my denial and refusal to accept it, I thought a girl could change me. I knew that I was cheating myself out of true happiness and I was always cheating her out of what she truly deserves. When I left her, I told her it\u2019s because we had grew apart, even though that wasn\u2019t the real reason. It was one of the hardest things I\u2019ve had to do, other than come out to my parents. Fast forward to the present, I have accepted being gay and I\u2019m not ashamed; it\u2019s who I am. My friends and family know and most have been supportive. \n\nSo that brings me to my question, should I tell my ex-wife?

I did love her and always will, I\u2019m just not heterosexual. Growing up in the south and the \u201cBible belt\u201d gay is only talked about in a negative manner. We started dating in 2013, married in 2018, and separated/divorced in July 2019. I left the marriage because I knew I was gay, I have always known but in my denial and refusal to accept it, I thought a girl could change me. I knew that I was cheating myself out of true happiness and I was always cheating her out of what she truly deserves. When I left her, I told her it\u2019s because we had grew apart, even though that wasn\u2019t the real reason. It was one of the hardest things I\u2019ve had to do, other than come out to my parents. Fast forward to the present, I have accepted being gay and I\u2019m not ashamed; it\u2019s who I am. My friends and family know and most have been supportive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that brings me to my question, should I tell my ex-wife?

abundance in my life in interesting and fulfilling ways.  In order to draw abundance to me, I must feel worthy of being abundant.  So to feel worthy I choose to be honest.  I allow all good to come to me by being generous with the people in my life.  I get what I give so I give my best.  I listen to my coworkers and my boss so that I am able to contribute to a cooperative work environment.  I practice enjoying my job whether I work on a chicken farm harvesting eggs or I am the star of a rock and roll band.  \n\nThe more I am able to focus on what I can offer my job, my family, my community, and my world the more relaxed I am.  My needs seem to take care of themselves when I do the next right thing.  I pay my bills on time.  I spend time volunteering with people who inspire me that way I feel inspired.

As we become adults, our childhood beliefs serve us less well \u2013 and the resultant behaviours may be incongruent with the situation we are in. This leads to the conclusion that one of the things it means to grow up, is to develop out of our childhood beliefs and adopt a new set of beliefs that will serve us better as adults. This progression follows a broad pattern of developing from dependence as children to independence as young adults to interdependence as mature adults. \n\nOur overall set of beliefs are developing all the time. However, most of us will carry some of our childhood beliefs with us in to adulthood. Most of these will be innocuous most of the time but some of them will, sometimes, impede our performance as high functioning, inter-dependent, adults. As adults, we benefit from identifying our limiting beliefs, and growing in to more valuable beliefs. \n\nBy way of an example, a common limiting belief sitting under the Imposter Syndrome umbrella is \u2018I must compare myself to others\u2019 which can be re-framed to \u2018I live my own life on my own terms\u2019 or \u2018I have a unique set of character strengths, as do others\u2019. In turn the re-framed beliefs can underpin valuable affirmations such as \u2018Because I live my own life, I enjoy the successes of others\u2019 or \u2018I choose to celebrate my successes without reference to other\u2019s accomplishments\u2019 or \u2018The fact that I choose to live my life authentically means I only compare myself against my own standards\u2019. \n\nA standard element of working with PERMA hypnotherapy is developing a high degree of self-awareness via exploring your characters strengths, values, beliefs and limiting beliefs which paves the way to defining your identity. In turn, this leaves you ideally placed to choose your own best future. \n\nWorking with a hypnotherapist is particularly well suited to personal development in this area as \u2013 by its very nature \u2013 it opens up the pathways between the parts we know and recognise as \u2018us\u2019 and the deeper levels of our wisdom: ideal for when we need to take those big steps forward.", "author_fullname": "t2_8idrovo3", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "And who do you think you are?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/selfimprovement", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_u0e0ui", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1649582345.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.selfimprovement", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t belong here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who do I think I am?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m a fraud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who am I getting ideas above my station?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m not worthy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is this really me?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Imposter Syndrome.
