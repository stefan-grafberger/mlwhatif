Still mobile. Hung my shingle out for takers. Nothing. All too far away anyway.\n\nLive in a less populated state west of the Mississippi. I'm my &lt;100k town for government work tied to a specific geographic location.\n\nI've gotten better because I've created like 5 tulpa creations to keep the worst of the depression at bay. \n\nOn two antidepressants and finished with my second mental health professional. This one was Harvard educated with a PhD. Nice that they still forced me to get a therapist myself. Oh yeah I have a job and benefits but I still have to go looking around for help like it's a secret.\n\nEvery single day I hear about people in relationships I just want to do a combination of cry and see them engulfed in coronal plasma. \n\nI literally would take forced sexual encounters if I could get cuddled afterwards. My love language is touch and words of affirmation but fuck that I don't get any. Nope not at all.\n\nI've had a series of long distance relationships that all end up ending by them. I've never broken up with anyone in my entire life.\n\nI had to change my schedule so I didn't have to get up so many days if the week because I lacked the basic motivation to do anything.\n\nOh yeah did I mention that no one in my entire life has come up to me talking about my good looks or being attracted to me ever? Yeah that includes anyone of any sexuality or gender. That hurts badly.\n\nOh even better. On the one dating app where I have a better statistical chance of getting someone I literally matched with one of my coworkers. I couldn't be more mortified if I came to work naked. \n\nWell maybe then.\n\nAnd of course they ghosted me. Yeah..... I feel awesome.\n\nTo think there are people out there who cheat on their partners. I wouldn't do that. \n\nI'm a loyal person.

Yeah that includes anyone of any sexuality or gender. That hurts badly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh even better. On the one dating app where I have a better statistical chance of getting someone I literally matched with one of my coworkers. I couldn&amp;#39;t be more mortified if I came to work naked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well maybe then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And of course they ghosted me. Yeah.....

We lived together right after we started dating. A year or so into our relationship, we opened up our relationship and decided to try polyamory. Well, it works for us and here we are. We now live with our joint partner E (32 NB) and S ( 31 M). I date all of them, E dates R and I. Honeestly, I love them all so much and this is what works for us.\n\nAnyways, the dynamic doesn't really matter. The point is that when 2020 hit and I lost my job, I started my own marketing and design business. It was a slow start, but eventually grew and grew until I could basically quit my new job at the time and support myself. I was making great money for a while. \n\nWell, I had a fucking shit year. Starting last fall, I found out that my stepfather, who raped me when I was young, suicided. I never told anyone and eventually needed to / had to when I wouldn't go to the funeral. Queue me and my youngest sister becoming very distant because she didn't know this about her dad and dealing with all of that mental nonsense in my head. Then, my stepmom got colon cancer. Everything was hot, cold, and up in the air for a couple of months and I took a couple of trips with money from my business savings (for taxes) because I was scared something would happen to her and I wanted to be there, for her and my dad and myself. THEN my grampa died. Then I got Covid. This all happened in about 3-4 months last fall through January 2022. \n\nI ended up getting very behind on work. All of my clients were understanding until my being behind due to my shit mental health started impacting them more. I lost a few clients right before I was about to expand my business. I had already gone through interviews, hiring, contracts, onboarding, etc. I knew I couldn't handle it all anymore and then it just felt like my entire business slid away out of my grasp even though I was trying as hard as I possibly could at the time, despite everything.\n\nSo I am tabling my business for now and keeping it as a side hustle so I can help people who need it the most. Keeping a few clients in the meantime, but it doesn't amount to much each month. On top of all of this, I have recently been diagnosed with a scary mental health issue and now a lot of things in my life, and brain, make sense. I've started new meds and it's been incredibly hard and scary sometimes, though it will be beneficial in the long run and I'm thankful for that. \n\nI'm trying to focus on finding a job, a full-time, benefits, professional, fucking job. Structure and static income are what I need right now. I've had many jobs like this before, but I need one now more than ever. E and S (and even E's sister and BIL!) have been as utterly supportive as possible between their own lives and jobs. Offering to give me advice, sending me jobs with people they know, reviewing cover letters and resume edits, being encouraging, etc. \n\nIt has been really hard. I've applied to so many places. I've never had trouble finding a job before. I have years upon years of customer service, education, training, consulting, software, design, branding, and marketing experience, and no one's biting. I can't even land interviews regularly. \n\nThis is the worst time I've EVER had looking for a job, ever. I have recently started feeling incredibly unmotivated and disheartened by this. Thinking things like \"Why would they hire me? At least 50 other people probably applied at a minimum and I'm sure there's someone more impressive that matches the description way better.\" Thinking nobody is interested, thinking that I've honed my skills for nearly 10 years now and it's amounted to nothing. I'm so fucking poor and depressed, I cry nearly every day and somehow still manage to apply to at least a few jobs every week, but it takes 10x more energy than it did when I started. It sucks. \n\nR cannot seem to do anything outside of himself. I feel as if I cannot rely on him for anything and he is blind to issues that don't directly impact him or have him as the \"victim\" in some way. Today, I lined up about 5 jobs I feel actually excited about applying for. I was telling R about them and asked if he could help keep me accountable tomorrow (Friday) and ask how things were going tomorrow since my goal is to apply to all of them by the end of the day, depending on how long it takes to write my cover letters and make any necessary resume edits. He straight up said, \"No, I can't do that.\" \n\nIt's entirely his right to say no and not take time doing that, I guess I just feel like he doesn't even know me or understand me as a person anymore at this point. In the past, he has become flustered when I ask him to review my cover letters (he has a creative writing degree, has written books, and regularly writes copy for marketing and business initiatives, he is literally the BEST person I could ask to review my material prior to submission) and he often says he can't or is not interested or gets annoyed when I ask him. He has helped me with a couple of cover letters, but like I said, seems to be annoyed whenever I ask him.\n\nAt this point, I feel like I should just fuck off and not expect anything from him. Even the other night when  I was crying in bed talking to E he was rolling around playing with the pets and touching my vagina while E and I were having a very serious conversation in which I was crying and lamenting my brain and E was so encouraging and perfectly supportive. R doesn't even fucking remember it after I brought it up twice, once the same night and the day after.\n\nOn top of all of this, I have barely been sleeping with E or R and somehow feel closer to E in an emotional and mental capacity even if we aren't sexually intimate very regularly. Today I mentioned that it would be nice if R and E initiated sleeping together one on one more and that I didn't feel right putting energy into our triad sleep-togethers and intimacy (threesomes) because I feel like I am still working on and repairing things with both E and R in very different ways. His immediate response when it turned into a conversation (I was not angry or upset, merely talking calmly) was that he didn't \"want to talk about another thing.\" He did come back and apologize for being dismissive soon after, but the words are there. How do I know he cares about anything I bring up to him without being annoyed or simply having the conversation because he feels obligated rather than invested? I don't feel heard or supported or cared for or considered.\n\nIDK if I'm asking for advice, but I guess I am. My brain is a mess and I'm struggling. \n\nTLDR; my partner can't seem to keep in tune with me. I'm struggling to find a job or even continue applying due to months of applications and depression. I'm also struggling in our relationship and he doesn't get it or have the \"capacity\" for \"another conversation\" when important things come up that aren't just a simple fucking conversation.", "author_fullname": "t2_3nn35poy", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Feeling Disheartened and Discouraged", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_xlh1vv", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1663889710.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.depression", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am 28 (NB) I have been with R (32 M) for nearly three years in November.

His immediate response when it turned into a conversation (I was not angry or upset, merely talking calmly) was that he didn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;want to talk about another thing.&amp;quot; He did come back and apologize for being dismissive soon after, but the words are there. How do I know he cares about anything I bring up to him without being annoyed or simply having the conversation because he feels obligated rather than invested? I don&amp;#39;t feel heard or supported or cared for or considered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IDK if I&amp;#39;m asking for advice, but I guess I am. My brain is a mess and I&amp;#39;m struggling. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR; my partner can&amp;#39;t seem to keep in tune with me. I&amp;#39;m struggling to find a job or even continue applying due to months of applications and depression. I&amp;#39;m also struggling in our relationship and he doesn&amp;#39;t get it or have the &amp;quot;capacity&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;another conversation&amp;quot; when important things come up that aren&amp;#39;t just a simple fucking conversation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "xlh1vv", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "doodleflopbop", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/xlh1vv/feeling_disheartened_and_discouraged/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/xlh1vv/feeling_disheartened_and_discouraged/", "subreddit_subscribers": 927660, "created_utc": 1663889710.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext": "I've been bullied for most of my whole life, but recently I feel like I'm in autopilot every time I get bullied.

over them. I'm in my last year of college and yet I hardly feel like I have my life together. I have to commute 1.5 hours from my house using public transportation and it's not too safe to commute after dark so I can't afford to stay long after class with my friend group and because of this I'm not close to anyone as I could be and feel hella FOMO. I'm always the first one to leave and it pains me to do so when everyone else either dorms or has a 30 min commute. I don't even have my driver's license and even then, my parents wouldn't let me have my own car until after I graduate at the very least. I couldn't even get any internship over the summer and so I will have to look for a job without one. I've yet to have a girlfriend because I'm too scared to ask and get rejected again. I spent years longing for this one girl even after that happened and it made me feel like something was wrong with me when she was dating all these other guys except me. My mind would always get pervaded with thoughts like \"What is it these guys have that I don't?\" or \"Why couldn't I get a chance?\". To me, life is just this same endless cycle I go to school, go home, do homework, and maybe game if I have time. I can't help but feel like an absolute loser compared to other people my age.

I&amp;#39;m in my last year of college and yet I hardly feel like I have my life together. I have to commute 1.5 hours from my house using public transportation and it&amp;#39;s not too safe to commute after dark so I can&amp;#39;t afford to stay long after class with my friend group and because of this I&amp;#39;m not close to anyone as I could be and feel hella FOMO. I&amp;#39;m always the first one to leave and it pains me to do so when everyone else either dorms or has a 30 min commute. I don&amp;#39;t even have my driver&amp;#39;s license and even then, my parents wouldn&amp;#39;t let me have my own car until after I graduate at the very least. I couldn&amp;#39;t even get any internship over the summer and so I will have to look for a job without one. I&amp;#39;ve yet to have a girlfriend because I&amp;#39;m too scared to ask and get rejected again. I spent years longing for this one girl even after that happened and it made me feel like something was wrong with me when she was dating all these other guys except me. My mind would always get pervaded with thoughts like &amp;quot;What is it these guys have that I don&amp;#39;t?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Why couldn&amp;#39;t I get a chance?&amp;quot;.
