For example if you work a job you hate, or work 80 hours a week you will have depression. If you do not spend time doing what you love or have nobody to love you will have depression. \n\nThe Pharma industry makes billions off of making you believe that something is inherently wrong with you instead of what's wrong with your situation. If you are set believing that there is nothing you can externally do to cure your depression you will be at the mercy of drug and other toxins.\n\nThe number of people with severe genetic depression is almost miniscule. Most people suffer from trauma from childhood or lack of social standing and community involvement. Our society no longer has any sense of community. Just wake up, eat a bunch of sugar filled food, pay your bills, sit in traffic for an hour go to work for 8-16 hours and then drive home go to sleep and repeat.\n\nAmerica is the most depressed nation on earth because we have sold out community for profit. Having an environment that promotes healthy living is a big no no for the people who profit off of our suffering. A lot of times people just need someone to talk to but absolutely no one is willing to listen. Depression is highly stigmatized. I remember coming to my parents about depression when I was a teen and they practically laughed at me. At that moment I realized the problem wasn't me but the people who i have surrounded myself with. i got new friends and kept family interactions to a minimum. I also got a new job because the last one was paid torture. \n\nThey make it seem like it is our fault, which is the reason depression is so highly frowned upon. Fuck 'em. If you want to make big changes to your lifestyle and piss people off do it. If you want to learn a new instrument, practice singing in the rain, dance, draw, or just fuck around do it if it makes you happy. The problem isn't you the problem is that you have been fooled into thinking that doing what society tells you will make you happy and when choosing what society makes you happy over what makes you happy fails they say you are depressed. It is all a lie to get us into a state of institutionalized insanity where our own thoughts have no validity.

If you do not spend time doing what you love or have nobody to love you will have depression. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Pharma industry makes billions off of making you believe that something is inherently wrong with you instead of what&amp;#39;s wrong with your situation. If you are set believing that there is nothing you can externally do to cure your depression you will be at the mercy of drug and other toxins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The number of people with severe genetic depression is almost miniscule. Most people suffer from trauma from childhood or lack of social standing and community involvement. Our society no longer has any sense of community. Just wake up, eat a bunch of sugar filled food, pay your bills, sit in traffic for an hour go to work for 8-16 hours and then drive home go to sleep and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;America is the most depressed nation on earth because we have sold out community for profit. Having an environment that promotes healthy living is a big no no for the people who profit off of our suffering. A lot of times people just need someone to talk to but absolutely no one is willing to listen. Depression is highly stigmatized. I remember coming to my parents about depression when I was a teen and they practically laughed at me. At that moment I realized the problem wasn&amp;#39;t me but the people who i have surrounded myself with. i got new friends and kept family interactions to a minimum. I also got a new job because the last one was paid torture. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They make it seem like it is our fault, which is the reason depression is so highly frowned upon. Fuck &amp;#39;em. If you want to make big changes to your lifestyle and piss people off do it. If you want to learn a new instrument, practice singing in the rain, dance, draw, or just fuck around do it if it makes you happy. The problem isn&amp;#39;t you the problem is that you have been fooled into thinking that doing what society tells you will make you happy and when choosing what society makes you happy over what makes you happy fails they say you are depressed. It is all a lie to get us into a state of institutionalized insanity where our own thoughts have no validity. Yes you are sad, because your life fucking sucks and the people around you are constantly exploiting you for personal gain at the expense of your mental, spiritual and physical wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "z8cry9", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fallenlegend117", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": null, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/z8cry9/depression_i_a_result_of_lifestyle_not_genetics/", "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/z8cry9/depression_i_a_result_of_lifestyle_not_genetics/", "subreddit_subscribers": 927660, "created_utc": 1669771350.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext": "I (15yr female) got stressed out one day because I thought my girlfriend would think I\u2019m weird because sometimes I skip showers when I\u2019m really tired. \n\nIt was never really have it for me in the first place growing up.

\n\nYesterday, for the first time in probably two-ish years, I thought about self-harming again. \n\nIt's been a really long time since I've done it, and I know that I won't because I live with my boyfriend and it would be obviously really upsetting to him. But it's just very hard to live right now. My boyfriend does his best to support me and he does really well in moments, but I don't think he understands how long-lasting it can be.\n\nI've never been this depressed while living with him (we've been living together for around 8 months now) and I'm finding it quite hard to keep it together since I don't have a lot of personal space.

No thyroid medicine.  No diabetes medicine.  No medicine to protect my kidneys.  No depression medicine.  No anxiety medicine.  No allergy medicine.  Nothing else.\n\nI told him that I'm not well.  That was really hard to admit.\n\nI confessed to him that I haven't seen a therapist in the last ten years.  I told him that - I know this is illogical - but I have convinced myself that since I have extensive training and experience in the field, what they're going to do isn't going to work for me.\n\nI know it's not true.  Every therapist has different skills, different experiences.  More than that, I know - in the very core of everything that I am - that the single most important factor in patient response to therapy is the patient-therapist relationship.  Not the therapeutic approach.  Not the techniques. \n\nHe asked about my support system.  I told him I don't have one.\n\nIn 2009, I moved across the country by myself on a bus.  I have a husband, but we've been separated for about the last four years.  And that's why I'm really here... at least, sort of.\n\nAfter the first few years, our relationship wasn't great.  He became emotionally distant from me and, ultimately, I cheated on him.  As a result of my infidelity - however distant it may have been - we ended up separating.\n\nThere's no excusing what I did.  There's also no excuse for what I'm doing now.\n\nFor the last four years, I have been punishing myself.\n\nI loved him.  I defined myself by my relationship to him.  I still do.\n\nTelling my doctor yesterday how deep my depression is - telling him that there is no antidepressant to fix what I feel - telling him that I am punishing myself... it forced me to admit it.  And I know it's true... I've known it's true all along - but I've never admitted it before.\n\nI have no social support system.  All my relationships are professional.  I am the lead counselor - I direct a team of 10 other counselors across two schools.  I provide guidance and mentorship.  They are \"friends\" but they're not really *friends.*\n\nI haven't left my apartment in two months.  I haven't showered in two weeks.  I couldn't tell you when the last time was that I brushed my teeth.  Yesterday, the *only* time I got out of bed was when I had my tele-health appointment with my physician.\n\nI'm moving tomorrow.\n\nI took off Thursday and Friday to clean... and instead, I lay in bed.\n\nI get up to go pee, to poop, to get food or something to drink.\n\nI am actively - if not consciously - punishing myself for being unfaithful to my husband... for being a coward, for not standing up for our relationship when I had the opportunity.  For letting him down.  For letting me down.\n\nOne of my co-workers is an athletic trainer; last year, he tore his meniscus.  He told me that it was difficult for him to acknowledge that he couldn't fix the issue.\n\nI'm in the same boat.\n\nI'm a therapist.  I am supposed to have the answers.  I am supposed to fix the problems.  I am supposed to teach the coping skills.  I spent fourteen years in college to become the absolute best.\n\nAnd now, I have to admit that I'm too close to this situation to fix it.  I have to rely on somebody else.\n\nI see my doctor in-person in two weeks.  I've made an appointment to see a psychiatric nurse practitioner on November 4th, and now, I'm going to make an appointment to see a counselor.\n\nI have to forgive myself.  I have to let go.  I have to stop existing and start living again.\n\nI know I deserve better.  But what I know and what I feel - I just can't make them match.\n\nYet.\n\nI have to remember those three letters.\n\nI remind the kids I work with of that all the time - *remember the power of YET.*  Just because you aren't there doesn't mean you won't get there.  Just because it's difficult now doesn't mean it will always be difficult.\n\nI haven't forgiven myself ***yet****.*  I haven't let go ***yet***.  I haven't started living ***yet****.*\n\nBut I'm alive... so there's still hope.\n\nI hope.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Punishing Myself for Being Unfaithful", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "hidden": false, "pwls": null, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_xyylnp", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1665250517.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": null, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "domain": "self.depression", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m saying this because I need to put it into words...

You saw the title, I was left home to baby sit my dog, American Bulldog. He's quite big.\nAnyway, I was on call with a friends and heard him barking so I went to see what was hoping kn and he was just barking at this hedgehog (massive hedgehog, probably like a 2/3 football/soccer ball).\n\nI uh, I stopped him yelling and got him inside for a moment and appologiesed to the hedgehog, the poor thing was just sleeping and chilling, minding it's own business.\n\nThen when I went inside, my dog ran outside. I yelled at him and he began barking at it again. I ended my call with my friend just as I was screaming because he now had it in his mouth and began shaking it. I ended the call and tried to stop him by yelling but he didn't stop, instead he threw it at our roof (it's low) and at the garage door, and at me.\n\nIt landed on the floor with a splat and he kept \"playing\" with it. I called my mum because I was home alone and panicking suddenly. My dog kept playing with it like a ball and I went to get some after to throw at him so he'd stop and run off but then as I walked away I stopped.\n\nI heard it scream for a moment. My dog was laughing and playing but I heard that hedgehog cry and scream. It did that for about 30 seconds before it was suddenly quiet before he started barking again. \n\nBy this point I had screamed at him to stop it but it was dark out and the light reflection in his eyes made him look terrifying. I felt so helpless.\n\nWhen I saw what he'd done, I just starred at it for a moment. \n\nHe'd shredded it. It was dead. He'd skinned part of it and there were chunks up the driveway. I saw its guts and blood everywhere on the floor.\n\nThen when I saw my dog again he was covered in blood. His mouth was bright red qnd he seemed to be happy with his new toy that he played with. He couldn't tell why I was screaming and crying.\n\nEverything inside me felt sick. About 3 minutes ago it was sleeping, now it had been shredded across my garden and wall. It looked like skinned chicken with guts pouring out.\n\nA neighbour came round because I'd begged my mum to call him. He walks our dog, loves him. But when he saw what had happened, he even felt sick. I just stood there, staring at it with my phone torch.\n\nHe stopped me and helped me clean up my dog. We cleaned the blood off him best we could and such. He covered the body with a bag and after 20 minutes left after sorting everything out.\n\nI walked back into my house and just collapsed on the floor. I. Can't explain the feeling. I felt sick. I kept hearing it's screaming in my head while my dog barked at it. I just stopped. Everything felt so wrong. My dog couldn't tell what was wrong and tried to give me a kiss and hug but I didn't want to look at him. I pushed him away and locked him in the living room behind a gate, I turned around and hid behind a wall before collapsing again. Like I couldn't control myself. It was. It hurt. \n\nIt felt like gravity both existed and didn't exist at once. Like the floor pulled me and I just couldn't stand anymore. I felt so weak and helpless.\n\nI've had depression for around 5-7 years. For some reason I've never been fussed about death, for myself or others. But watching that happen just hurt a lot. Watching as my dog had fun with this poor helpless thing that screamed for help while I couldn't breathe nor move. It felt sick. He doesn't even know, nor understand. That thing was sleeping and got mauled to death by something it stood little to no chance against. All it could do was scream. It sounded like a baby. \n\nI just can't understand why it had to happen. It sounds so stupid, dogs kill hedgehogs all the time. But it felt so wrong. It was sleeping and now its guts are in a bag along with chunks of its body and ripped up flesh. And my dog thought it was a fun game he tried to get his owner involved with. \n\nI don't know but after that I just realised how unfair life is. How he won't ever feel regret nor understand what just happened. All it was was a fun 30 seconds game which he won. Nothing else. Nothing more than a twinkle in his eye.\n\nBut that hedgehog had a whole life. Sure it wasn't a human life, but I think they're conscious enough, more than a mindless critter at least. It might have been a 1 in a billion hedgehogs but it died such a grewsome death. That must be terrifying. I felt terrified just watching it.\n\nIt just made me realise how terrible and unfair life is. How that hedgehog won't ever be Rememebered other than from me. Ever. It's just as pointless as some dust on the floor. \n\nAnd then one thing lead to another and humans are just the same. We're terrible. We live in a society made up with these weird, funny little rules so we can live in a some what comfortable way best we can. We have religions and beliefs, we go to school to learn about what our anncesstors did, we have clocks to tell us how the sun's working, we have clothes and objects all made by thousands of other humans across the globe with thousands of different lives.\n\nBut in the big picture that's all it is. Humanity. Its just a species that learnt one way to try and see life as something more than it is. Unfair, cruel, and over all pointless.\n\nLife is pointless. That's why no one can find a meaning. There really is no point. I thought it was to find happiness, but it's not. Life as a whole universal experience has no purpose other than live, survive, die. Cells made up to compose you. Tiny atoms built up in certain ways to create everything you know.\n\nThings get killed all the time. Things happen all the time. For example, the other day I decided to clean my whole house for my mum to hopefully make her feel better.. the next day this happened. \nLast week I was going to kill myself, the next day every class I had my teachers for some reason tried to make me laugh. I don't even know why.\nMy whole life I've tried to be a good kid but now that I'm applying to collages and such, we'll I realise how mediocre I am. How much I haven't done. How useless I actually am. I made one mistake and that's what I'm seen as from now on because I was so perfect. I don't have any motivations anymore.\n\nLife is unfair.\n\nNot what parents say to you when something bad happens, but existence as a whole has no obligation to do anything for or to you. It creates life, and destroys it.\n\nI used to love space. My whole life. Every night for 6 years I look up at the sky to see the stars because I think they're so beautiful.. but tonight I can't see any beauty at all.. the NASA photos made me feel sick and seeing every star in the sky is like seeing a vast void of endless suffering. \n\nIt feels like emptiness. Like there's this void consumed by my body. I'm someone who thinks about people as their brains. I won't go into it but I just can't image how that Hedgehog felt or what it was feeling. All I know is that it screamed until it died. It was horrible.\n\nI don't know how so many people settled for this world we live in. The only reason I'm alive right now is because I cant kill myself for my mum. I don't even know if she deserves it but she can't have her firstborn kill herself. But I can't keep doing this anymore. I just can't. \n\nI keep convincing myself it'll be okay but tonight just shows me that everything is pointless. Humans, animals, life and existence as a whole is disgusting. This isn't the individuals, just the entirety of everything. Every atom I'm touching makes me feel sick, everything makes me feel sick. Everything.\n\nBut I can't ever escape it. Even after death. I can't every stop existing. I'll just be a very small part in a massive puzzle, bigger than any of us could ever imagine. And I can't do anything to stop it or change that. Ever.\n\nI'm sorry. You can call me stupid or childish for feeling like this over a hedge hog, but I don't care anymore. I'm sick of this. Of everything. It doesn't get better and its like the universe is pushing me further than the edge itself at this point.\n\nSo yeah, I don't know what to do after seeing my dog kill a hedgehog...", "author_fullname": "t2_ahtif1tj", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "I don't know what to do after seeing my dog kill a hedge hog", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "hidden": false, "pwls": null, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_xkj0j5", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1663798957.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": null, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.depression", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 15, nearly 16(f).

My dog couldn&amp;#39;t tell what was wrong and tried to give me a kiss and hug but I didn&amp;#39;t want to look at him. I pushed him away and locked him in the living room behind a gate, I turned around and hid behind a wall before collapsing again. Like I couldn&amp;#39;t control myself. It was. It hurt. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It felt like gravity both existed and didn&amp;#39;t exist at once. Like the floor pulled me and I just couldn&amp;#39;t stand anymore. I felt so weak and helpless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had depression for around 5-7 years. For some reason I&amp;#39;ve never been fussed about death, for myself or others. But watching that happen just hurt a lot. Watching as my dog had fun with this poor helpless thing that screamed for help while I couldn&amp;#39;t breathe nor move. It felt sick. He doesn&amp;#39;t even know, nor understand. That thing was sleeping and got mauled to death by something it stood little to no chance against. All it could do was scream. It sounded like a baby. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just can&amp;#39;t understand why it had to happen. It sounds so stupid, dogs kill hedgehogs all the time. But it felt so wrong. It was sleeping and now its guts are in a bag along with chunks of its body and ripped up flesh. And my dog thought it was a fun game he tried to get his owner involved with. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know but after that I just realised how unfair life is. How he won&amp;#39;t ever feel regret nor understand what just happened. All it was was a fun 30 seconds game which he won. Nothing else. Nothing more than a twinkle in his eye.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that hedgehog had a whole life. Sure it wasn&amp;#39;t a human life, but I think they&amp;#39;re conscious enough, more than a mindless critter at least. It might have been a 1 in a billion hedgehogs but it died such a grewsome death. That must be terrifying. I felt terrified just watching it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just made me realise how terrible and unfair life is. How that hedgehog won&amp;#39;t ever be Rememebered other than from me. Ever. It&amp;#39;s just as pointless as some dust on the floor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then one thing lead to another and humans are just the same. We&amp;#39;re terrible. We live in a society made up with these weird, funny little rules so we can live in a some what comfortable way best we can. We have religions and beliefs, we go to school to learn about what our anncesstors did, we have clocks to tell us how the sun&amp;#39;s working, we have clothes and objects all made by thousands of other humans across the globe with thousands of different lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in the big picture that&amp;#39;s all it is. Humanity. Its just a species that learnt one way to try and see life as something more than it is. Unfair, cruel, and over all pointless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Life is pointless. That&amp;#39;s why no one can find a meaning. There really is no point. I thought it was to find happiness, but it&amp;#39;s not. Life as a whole universal experience has no purpose other than live, survive, die. Cells made up to compose you. Tiny atoms built up in certain ways to create everything you know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things get killed all the time. Things happen all the time. For example, the other day I decided to clean my whole house for my mum to hopefully make her feel better.. the next day this happened. \nLast week I was going to kill myself, the next day every class I had my teachers for some reason tried to make me laugh. I don&amp;#39;t even know why.\nMy whole life I&amp;#39;ve tried to be a good kid but now that I&amp;#39;m applying to collages and such, we&amp;#39;ll I realise how mediocre I am. How much I haven&amp;#39;t done. How useless I actually am. I made one mistake and that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m seen as from now on because I was so perfect. I don&amp;#39;t have any motivations anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Life is unfair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not what parents say to you when something bad happens, but existence as a whole has no obligation to do anything for or to you. It creates life, and destroys it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to love space. My whole life. Every night for 6 years I look up at the sky to see the stars because I think they&amp;#39;re so beautiful.. but tonight I can&amp;#39;t see any beauty at all.. the NASA photos made me feel sick and seeing every star in the sky is like seeing a vast void of endless suffering. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It feels like emptiness. Like there&amp;#39;s this void consumed by my body. I&amp;#39;m someone who thinks about people as their brains. I won&amp;#39;t go into it but I just can&amp;#39;t image how that Hedgehog felt or what it was feeling. All I know is that it screamed until it died. It was horrible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how so many people settled for this world we live in. The only reason I&amp;#39;m alive right now is because I cant kill myself for my mum. I don&amp;#39;t even know if she deserves it but she can&amp;#39;t have her firstborn kill herself. But I can&amp;#39;t keep doing this anymore. I just can&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I keep convincing myself it&amp;#39;ll be okay but tonight just shows me that everything is pointless. Humans, animals, life and existence as a whole is disgusting. This isn&amp;#39;t the individuals, just the entirety of everything. Every atom I&amp;#39;m touching makes me feel sick, everything makes me feel sick. Everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I can&amp;#39;t ever escape it. Even after death. I can&amp;#39;t every stop existing. I&amp;#39;ll just be a very small part in a massive puzzle, bigger than any of us could ever imagine. And I can&amp;#39;t do anything to stop it or change that. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry. You can call me stupid or childish for feeling like this over a hedge hog, but I don&amp;#39;t care anymore. I&amp;#39;m sick of this. Of everything. It doesn&amp;#39;t get better and its like the universe is pushing me further than the edge itself at this point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I don&amp;#39;t know what to do after seeing my dog kill a hedgehog...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": true, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "xkj0j5", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ThoughtsThrewLife", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": null, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/xkj0j5/i_dont_know_what_to_do_after_seeing_my_dog_kill_a/", "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/xkj0j5/i_dont_know_what_to_do_after_seeing_my_dog_kill_a/", "subreddit_subscribers": 927660, "created_utc": 1663798957.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext": "I\u2019ve been struggling with self harm thoughts, i\u2019m gonna do it, today or tomorrow.", "author_fullname": "t2_7ijogfk", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "I\u2019ve made the decision to throw myself downstairs", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "hidden": false, "pwls": null, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_xikb55", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1663611731.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": null, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.depression", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve been struggling with self harm thoughts, i\u2019m gonna do it, today or tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "xikb55", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "deadflowers1", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 11, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": null, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/xikb55/ive_made_the_decision_to_throw_myself_downstairs/", "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/xikb55/ive_made_the_decision_to_throw_myself_downstairs/", "subreddit_subscribers": 927660, "created_utc": 1663611731.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext": "Okay so I made this fake account just to ask this here , cause i know my bf will see this post if i post it with my main account and i don\u2019t want an arguement over this \nSo here\u2019s the thing\nWe\u2019ve been together for 3 years now and we used to be that type of dream couple that everyone wants .

In \r\n2007 I was placed on disability because of my bipolar disorder. In 2018 disability decided I was cured and took my benefits. Within a year I lost everything. I ended up homeless without my kids once again addicted to drugs, after almost ten years of being clean. I was told they took my benefits because I was no longer seeing a \r\npsychiatrist. My primary care doctor took over prescribing. My meds weren't changing so why would I see a psychiatrist. In 2019 after less than a year out there I came home and entered treatment again. I started the long process of getting my disability back only to be denied. Then when I sent in my appeal, they claimed they never received it. Even though I sent a change of address along with my appeal which they received. I have reached out to so many people politicians, mental health advocates, so far nobody has been able to help. At this very moment I sleep on a couch in the home of my children's father. I have absolutely no income at all. I can't even get services through the county because they count our income jointly. My life was destroyed because someone thought I was not worthy of benefits, they wanted to save some money. But what they did was take everything from me. All the stability I gained is gone. I long so badly to just die. I have had a really hard life. I don't see any improvement and I feel like nobody cares. How to you keep going when you never look forward to tomorrow? Why was this allowed to happen to me? What did I do to deserve this? What they are telling those of us who are mentally ill, is that we will be punished if we reach anything that resembles stability. I come from a long line of mentally ill substance abusers. I lost my mom, dad, brother and uncle to overdoses. As well as a grandmother and brother to suicide. I'm tired, I can't keep fighting, I want so badly to just lay down and never wake up. But I have kids that I love very much. Right now I am living for them. I hate myself and everything about me \r\n I gave up on myself some time ago. But I can't give up on them, I live for them and for them alone. Because if it wouldn't hurt them so badly, I would just give up. I feel like nobody cares about how things have all went down. That I lost everything, my home which was only a trailer but it was mine. I no longer have a vehicle; I lost my beloved pets. I lost every possession I ever own. But most of all I lost myself. The woman I once was Being bipolar I am use to experiencing extreme highs and lows. For the past I would say almost a year it's all just been lows. I am so depressed; all I want to do is sleep. I cry over nothing, I stopped taking care of myself. It's because I no longer have any worth. I am a nobody, a moocher, the woman on the couch. I can't keep fighting this everyday. I'm so tired. I don't understand why me losing everything within a year of them taking my disability is not an a huge indicator that I need it. I have always been poor. But literally I have nothing. The huge difference between me today and before all this. Before I would get right up when life knocked me down. I feel like I'm down for the count. Nobody understands. I want to see online psychiatrist but I can't afford it. I have gained weight and my looks deteriorated so much, that I don't want people to see me. I'm disgusting and I hate myself so much. Why am I not stronger? Why can't I just be normal. My entire life all that I have know is abuse and poverty. Now I don't even have any fight left, I just want to give up. I know I can't that just makes it that much worse. My mental health has never been this bad. Not even when I was younger and things first started. Before I knew what was going on. Back then they gave me my disability on my first attempt. Because it was clear with all the hospitalizations that I was mentally ill. Now I should be in the hospital but don't have anyone to take care the kids while I'm away. I \r\nalso don't want them to think badly of me. They know I struggle with mental illness, but I haven't been hospitalized in so long. I have like 7 diagnoses. I don't believe I actually have all of them. I do know I have some but not all. For sure I suffer with extreme PTSD, bipolar disorder, ADHD and that's really the only ones I am sure of. I have seen on The Dr Phil show he sends people to this clinic for diagnostic testing. for diagnostic testing. Which from what I have learned from you tells you so much more about what part of your brain is malfunctioning. My life has been so hard. With the hand I was dealt I was honestly never had a chance at life. I never had anyone who I would call a positive role model. When I was younger, I was neglected by my family severely. I learned really young how to take care of myself. Begging for change or collecting pop cans to feed myself by the time I was 5. There was time when I would get individual attention from the adults around me. I carry the scars from those interactions still today. I am the youngest and the only girl out of 7 kids. I was sexually abused by 3 out of 5 of my brothers. Not to mention numerous others. It has carried over into my adult life. I used to think I gave off some signal that told these men they could do these things to me. How else would they find me and know I would put up with such things? I did one time I tried to press charges on a boss who was making sexually explicit comments to me and grabbing me. They treated me like I was nothing but a dirt lying whore. I never want to feel that way again. I spoke in my previous letter about my brother Norm who killed himself in 2018. The reason he did that is because his dirty secret came out. It came out that he had raped his stepson numerous over the 30 years he had known him. I was his first victim; I think I was just an experiment because when I was 5 he stopped and never did anything inappropriate until just a couple months before he killed himself. I have just started speaking to him again after years of being estranged. He wanted to tell me a secret and ask me for help. He told me he enjoyed dressing up as a woman and having sex with men. He wanted to know if I would help him get better at doing his makeup and stuff. Then he started stopping by my house after he would get out of work at night. He always brought beer with him which is a huge trigger for me. Most of the abuse I have endure that smell was always present. I came to fear people who drank beer. So one night he comes over. He strips down completely naked except for a skimpy ladies\u2019 robe and started to sodomized himself with a sex toy that he brought over. I felt so uncomfortable, I didn't know what to do. Suddenly I was a child again and frozen with fear. You see my who family has abandoned me. Either because they are afraid, I will expose something they did or just because emotionally in my late teens early 20's when everyone jumped ship, I was a lot to handle. I hadn't had anyone besides my kids since my brother tommy died of an overdose in 2014. So, part of me was almost going to allow it to keep happening just because I wanted someone there for me. I just wanted someone to care. I did pull away from him and that's why the night before and the morning he killed himself I ignored his calls. Everyone was so angry with him that they didn't even want to honor his death. I didn't tell anyone about what he did to me when I was younger or right before he died. I was asked by a few family members who remember how close I was to him when I was little. How I slept in his bed. I said that it didn't happen when asked. But I did reach out to his stepson and apologize to him. If I wasn't so weak, I would have turned him down in for what he did to me. Then it wouldn't have happened to you. I have always wanted to right my story as a nonfiction novel. The plot was going to be about a woman who is suing CPS for not removing her from her home, even though they had evidence of neglect and abuse. Lots of people have failed along the way. I wish I could sue disability, because I will never get even close to getting back what I have lost. They don't even want to give it back to me. My primary care Dr who I have seen for over ten years wrote up a report for them. In her report she mentioned that I am completely blind in my left eye with extremely poor vision in my right. I'm pretty close to being legally blind but I'm not yet. Because that was in the report he made me go see a eye specialist. But my mental health which was what I was seeking disability for I only spoke to a psychiatrist for all of 3 \r\nminutes and was denied based on that meeting. Basically, they don't care that I received disability all those years. I am somehow miraculously cured. But I'm not I'm in probably the worst place I have ever been. I think about my death on a daily basis. My heart hurts so badly that I physically hurt. Please help me!!!!! Nobody else cares I'm a nobody. Please I need someone to stand up for me for just one time in my life. I have written to politicians asking them to help me. I didn't deserve this and neither did my kids. So far out of my 5 \r\nchildren my 24-year-old is drug addicted and mentally ill. My 20year-old is severely mentally ill diagnosed at just 8 with juvenile bipolar. My 14-year-old Madison, who is transgender and goes by the name Collin is struggling pretty aggressively. My 11-year-old daughter is showing signs and symptoms as well as my nine-yearold son. It's so sad that just because of who their mother is, there life is going to suck and they will struggle too. Please help us all!! Please get all of us evaluations through that diagnostic clinic and start us on treatment so that maybe just maybe I can find my will to live again. I have decided I am going to tell our story to anyone who will listen. My twelve-year-old daughter sees how sad I am. She has started making and selling keychains to raise money for our family will you please show her there is people out there who care. She has gotten so discouraged because she hasn\u2019t sold very many. I feel like our situation is hopeless. I need people to hear me.

In \n2007 I was placed on disability because of my bipolar disorder. In 2018 disability decided I was cured and took my benefits. Within a year I lost everything. I ended up homeless without my kids once again addicted to drugs, after almost ten years of being clean. I was told they took my benefits because I was no longer seeing a \npsychiatrist. My primary care doctor took over prescribing. My meds weren&amp;#39;t changing so why would I see a psychiatrist. In 2019 after less than a year out there I came home and entered treatment again. I started the long process of getting my disability back only to be denied. Then when I sent in my appeal, they claimed they never received it. Even though I sent a change of address along with my appeal which they received. I have reached out to so many people politicians, mental health advocates, so far nobody has been able to help. At this very moment I sleep on a couch in the home of my children&amp;#39;s father. I have absolutely no income at all. I can&amp;#39;t even get services through the county because they count our income jointly. My life was destroyed because someone thought I was not worthy of benefits, they wanted to save some money. But what they did was take everything from me. All the stability I gained is gone. I long so badly to just die. I have had a really hard life. I don&amp;#39;t see any improvement and I feel like nobody cares. How to you keep going when you never look forward to tomorrow? Why was this allowed to happen to me? What did I do to deserve this? What they are telling those of us who are mentally ill, is that we will be punished if we reach anything that resembles stability. I come from a long line of mentally ill substance abusers. I lost my mom, dad, brother and uncle to overdoses. As well as a grandmother and brother to suicide. I&amp;#39;m tired, I can&amp;#39;t keep fighting, I want so badly to just lay down and never wake up. But I have kids that I love very much. Right now I am living for them. I hate myself and everything about me \n I gave up on myself some time ago. But I can&amp;#39;t give up on them, I live for them and for them alone. Because if it wouldn&amp;#39;t hurt them so badly, I would just give up. I feel like nobody cares about how things have all went down. That I lost everything, my home which was only a trailer but it was mine. I no longer have a vehicle; I lost my beloved pets. I lost every possession I ever own. But most of all I lost myself. The woman I once was Being bipolar I am use to experiencing extreme highs and lows. For the past I would say almost a year it&amp;#39;s all just been lows. I am so depressed; all I want to do is sleep. I cry over nothing, I stopped taking care of myself. It&amp;#39;s because I no longer have any worth. I am a nobody, a moocher, the woman on the couch. I can&amp;#39;t keep fighting this everyday. I&amp;#39;m so tired. I don&amp;#39;t understand why me losing everything within a year of them taking my disability is not an a huge indicator that I need it. I have always been poor. But literally I have nothing. The huge difference between me today and before all this. Before I would get right up when life knocked me down. I feel like I&amp;#39;m down for the count. Nobody understands. I want to see online psychiatrist but I can&amp;#39;t afford it. I have gained weight and my looks deteriorated so much, that I don&amp;#39;t want people to see me. I&amp;#39;m disgusting and I hate myself so much. Why am I not stronger? Why can&amp;#39;t I just be normal. My entire life all that I have know is abuse and poverty.

I fell in love with the one I shouldn&amp;#39;t have. He told me he learn more about himself and grow while being with me. I can say the same but I can grow better if I didn&amp;#39;t fall in love with this person. I bet we had a good time but when I&amp;#39;m alone or drunk, all I have is resentment. I gave too much and received too little. I bet he felt the same. I don&amp;#39;t blame him. We are so different. Not just love language, but hobbies, values, interests. Almost polar opposite in every aspect. There is no one to blame. I logically know that. But there is SO MUCH pain. I feel less than enough whenever he compares me with his exes, his sisters, his mom. I hate feeling less than enough. I hate feeling that I&amp;#39;ll never be enough. That I can never make him happy. I am open to his hobbies. He loves sharing a lot of it. But when I tried to share, he washes it away or gives me the condition he will do something I like with me in exchange for me doing something for him. I do this sometimes to him as well though not as much. I can see for sure that we&amp;#39;re filled with resentment for one another. Sometimes, when alone I just screamed &amp;quot;I hate you so much, I resent you so much, but I love you so much&amp;quot; then I cried.

I would tell her everything that went on between us, and she told me that if there was something that I found truly worrisome, that I should tell her. Tonight, she sent me sketches from her job, which is nude modeling. The girl asked me if I knew about her job, which she had told me before, and I said yes. She sent two pictures saying \u201cMe. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m supposed to share them but I trust you.\u201d My girlfriend was drunk when she sent them, and I didn\u2019t have service so I didn\u2019t want to jump to any conclusions- but I was pretty sure she sent me nudes. I waited for my girlfriend to sober up a bit, so I could tell her when she was clear headed what happened. She\u2019s been very, understandably, silent. I\u2019ve gotten her to talk a bit, because otherwise we\u2019re just going to be upset with each other. I want to reassure her that she\u2019s safe with me. She told me, very sternly, looking at me for the first time in what felt like hours(twenty minute ride home) \u201cI am not afraid to break up with somebody that hurts me.\u201d I told her that I\u2019m proud of her for having those boundaries up. I\u2019m just so sad that I lead her this far to not trust me, and to hurt her. If I become so unhappy in our relationship, I would break up with her- but never cheat on her. \n\nNow I am feeling. I don\u2019t know if I should be strong, I don\u2019t know if I should hurt in front of her. Mostly, I want to hurt myself. But if I hurt myself, I would have to hide it from her. If I hurt myself and showed it to her, I feel like that would just be manipulative. There is a gun in the basement and I do not know if it is loaded. I\u2019ve always wanted to kill myself, or at least thought I did. I want to learn to be able to commit to it. I will leave a note, and try to make things okay for everybody, even though I know they will not be okay.
