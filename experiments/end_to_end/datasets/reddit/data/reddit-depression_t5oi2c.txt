I was at the comfort of my own home watching porn and you thought it was a good idea to film it!. Now when I go out people point fingers at me and shit thinking I was the one moaning when im not. You have absolutely zero morals and you are just a degenerate piece of shit. I know you filmed me you fucker and I know you posted it on social media. The worst part of this is that I don't even know where the fuck you posted that video, how many have watched and feasted on an underage girl?, and who even are you?.  I don't know your name and your my neighbor. I know its on social media by the way random people on public look at me. What benefit does it give to you that you filmed an underage girl huh? I hope I find the video you posted and I hope you get arrested for what you've done. Because of you I now have a fear of getting attention and you completely torn me apart. Saturday last week I was being pointed at by 3 men on a fast food chain. Why would 3 men that I don't know about point at me right? because of the fucker that took the video!. Yesterday 5 people where looking at me and no im not paranoid. These people keep looking at me to make sure it really was me!. I'm going through another episode of depression because of you. I hate that i'm all over the internet yet I still haven't found the video you posted!. I hate that the video most probably is still on the internet. I hate that you took a video of me and most probably pedophiles are enjoying it. I hate that people look at me differently because of that. I hate that if I ever found out the video I can't tell it to my parent's and take you to court because they will kill me and not you. Because of you I now have a hard time of even reaching my goals knowing that that video is all over the internet and people will only listen to one side and that's yours!. I hate how my life went from good to bad ever since you took that video.
