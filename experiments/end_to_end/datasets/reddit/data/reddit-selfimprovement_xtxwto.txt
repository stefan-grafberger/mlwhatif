Us ... or someone (or something else).\n\nYou can view love as a currency. Each day we wake up and we have so much in our bank account.\n\nWe give some to our dog ... because of course!\n\nWe give some to our favorite influencers on social media ... because they are so incredible!\n\nWe give some to our work ... to our family ... and to our friends.\n\nBut when it comes time to love ourselves ... far to often **we don't make the cut.**\n\nI'm here to explain **why you don't feel worthy** AND how you can **master Self Love.**\n\n\\#1. Our brain has certain ideas about who we should be and how we should act (we'll call this our ideal self)\n\n\\#2. We also have an idea of who we are / where we are in life.\n\n\\#3. The larger the gap between these two versions of ourself ... **the less worthy we feel.**\n\nHow do you learn to master Self Love?\n\n\\#1.

I don't wanna brag but I think im the most respected of my friend group. Let me know if you got any great tips or if I forgot something important. Here are some tips that in my opinion makes you command more respect from others:\n\n1. Not always taking credit. A example is: when you came up with a idee to give someone a gift don't tell that person it was your idee. If other people tell that person it was your idee they respect you more and probably think you do this more often.\n2. Give them advice in live or difficult situations if the time is right ofcourse. don't give random advise if there are not waiting for it.\n3. Do not always tell them what you up to but tell them what you did. A example: don't tell everyone you just started investing is for example stocks or crypto. Tell them after you made some money and how you did it. Give them advice if they ask for it. If you know what you talking about. Its okay to say that you just started and that you still have to learn a lot yourself\n4. Be yourself and have a unique style for example. I like to wear mech from artist i like. and don't let people change you or your perspective in life.\n5. Work on yourself (like doing meditation or work out) and share the benefits with others. don't brag about this just tell them what you did and how it made you feel. Don't force them to do it or make them belief your better because you doing these things to improve yourself.\n6. Even tho they respect you NEVER tell or try to make them belief your perfect. Let them see or know you flaws. Accept the help they offer you to fix this or try to listen to the advice they give you.\n7. Know that no matter how good you are in certain thing there will be always be someone better than you. Have respect for these people and try to learn from them.\n8. Don't lie about things you not doing or tell them about fake goals you never gonna reach.\n9. Don't be a know it all. Don't command every time someone is doing something work. For example: if you are painting a house with your friends don't command them on there skills. If you really want to command on them then first ask why thy do it that way and after that show them how you do it and tell them the benefits of doing it that way I also like to tell them where I learned doing it that way.\n10. last but definitely not least. NEVER CHEAT IN A RELATIONSHIP. In my opinion if your my friend you cheat on your girl then you will lose all the respect you eared or got and have to start over with a big minus. If you wanna recover from this you have to work really really hard on your self. I you do this for a second time than its done absolute no respect.

It was in the format of \u201cI, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(name)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;_ attract\u2026\u201d etc etc. That\u2019s how they were able to identify it as mine and call me to let me know they had it (as I say, I\u2019m a regular so my number in on past orders) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The vision board was so cringey. Literally all my hopes and dreams that I had photoshopped MYSELF into. I want to curl up and die \ud83d\ude02 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would appreciate a helpful / positive perspective on why this isn\u2019t really a bad thing. I\u2019m feeling deep levels of shame (I actually cried because it felt so personal and exposing). Do you have any advice as to how to accept myself / use self love to not worry about being \u201cexposed\u201d in this way? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit to add: While I don\u2019t KNOW the shop assistant well he follows me on instagram and follows my work which makes it extra embarrassing to me \ud83d\ude2d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmbm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "u2c6fe", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ill_Entertainment895", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfimprovement/comments/u2c6fe/someone_read_my_affirmations_saw_my_vision_board/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/u2c6fe/someone_read_my_affirmations_saw_my_vision_board/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1352066, "created_utc": 1649805617.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfimprovement", "selftext": "There\u2019s this guy that likes me.

Now reading doesn\u2019t necessarily need to just be books that your read \u2013 it can also be reading about research papers in your relevant field, it can be reading articles, it can be reading blogs as you are doing right now \u2013 it isn\u2019t only books that I encourage you to read, its any content that will bring value to you in your life.\n\nI was so inspired by the film Good Will Hunting and in the film the main character Will who was played by Matt Damon reads a considerable amount of books in his free time and there was one scene in particular which really did inspire me and that was when he was in the therapists room and he saw all the books on the shelves and he said that he read all the books on the shelves as if it was nothing to him. This amazed me and really encouraged me and inspired me to take up reading and have that be apart of my life.\n\nOne of the reasons why you should take up reading is because it allows you to become a more knowledgeable and sophisticated person and allows you to develop your vocabulary and allows you to know more about the world (especially if you are reading good books). But you should only read because you want to read \u2013 don\u2019t read just because I say it here in this article, read because you want to read and only read the content that you feel drawn to and content that you are interested in.\n\nReading also in my view allows you to become a lot better and a lot more developed person because it allows you to have a much clearer picture on the world, especially if you are reading the correct content \u2013 I can not emphasis this enough, because why should you read a book from someone who has 1 year experience in x subject when you can read a book written by someone who has 30 years of experience and has worked at multiple different companies? Point being is you should be selective of the content that you consume and only consume content which is of high value from people who know what they are talking about.\n\nAnother short point I just wanted to add here is that I believe that you shouldn\u2019t read the news too often because the news has just become so heavily politicized especially with the virus always on the news and being spoken about. It just isn\u2019t healthy for your mental health to constantly be watching the news every single day because bad news sells a lot more than good news and also how much value does the news really bring you in your life? Can you recall 5 articles that you read over the past month? I wager that most will say that they are not able to.\n\nIn conclusion, only take up reading because you want to take up reading and become the best version of yourself and only consume content which you feel drawn to and content which is of high value objectively speaking from people who are good writers/experts in their fields etc, because it will allow you to in one book read from an expert and this is of more value in my eyes than reading 100 books from people with very little experience in a subject. You also shouldn\u2019t read content just because they are the most popular \u2013 granted most popular does mean something, but you should read content which you believe will add value to you in your life and content which is of high quality.

the present moment), i was just binge stroking my meat. i actually started to get pretty frustratwd and overwhelmed about it. and that shit has a negative effect on you for real, i had such a high performance anexity in bed, that it was really hard for me to maintain an erection for a while.(no pressure tho and i could get real hard). so no shit was working for me, i tried all kinda of things like journaling, setting goals on this even doing pushups if i had a boner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the change came when i was kistening to an andrew tate podcast(you might like him or hate him, but you

Totally wrong. The successful people know deeply the importance of working smarter, by leveraging other tools, to get the same amount of results with the least amount of effort which kind of dentition of working smarter. The most ideal approach to be progressively successful at work is to concentrate on the main task at hand. Have you at any point truly needed to complete something, however for unknown reasons, you discover any motivation to stay away from it whatsoever expenses? I think this is something that we have all accomplished sooner or later in our lives. Research demonstrates that the issue is that our minds are modified to linger, and be lazy. We as a whole will in general battle with assignments that guarantee future upside as a byproduct \u200f\u200f\u200e of endeavors we take now. To put it plainly, it\u2019s simpler for your brain to process concrete versus conceptual things. This is not the slightest bit intended to be a reason for why you can\u2019t complete things. Being beneficial is a decision, much the same as dawdling is. So, let\u2019s delve into the 5 tips to work smarter not harder, to start be more efficient, and effective. ## 5 Powerful Ways To Work Smarter Not Harder #### 1.Leverage The first principle to work smarter not harder is called leverage. One the stubborn way to work harder, and getting scrips, or any of it at all, is to go things about your own. BIG factual mistakes leading to disaster. We are here to work, and to be together to build a great world, and that smartest thing to do in your life. We should leverage each other. The person who locks himself in his little ego, and claim that doesn\u2019t need help will always any results, but more so, is more likely to fail. Having an open mind is the key. For example, if you want to start a YouTube channel, what most people do? They start searching in the FREE Taking hours, and hours of their times, being all over the place, confused, and guess what at end? Tiny results. That the sloppy way of working. A smart person on the other hand, will leverage other people\u2019s experiences, by buying a step by step course, or asking for coaching, to point out the right direction, avoiding pitfalls, saving years, and making enormous results. That\u2019s working SMART. #### 2.Start with the difficult, and most important task first. The second thing you would do to work smarter not harder is to begin the hardest task. Here\u2019s why: You see, the only thing that is hindering us from getting to our goals is **procrastination**. Building momentum is a muscle like any muscle in your body. When you start with a difficult task, this muscle will reinforce itself, as time goes on, your ability to kick your ass off will become easier, and from that, results will be attained much faster. It\u2019s work, this is how life works. Also know that we just have such a great amount of time in one day. In the event that you believe that you will almost certainly achieve each and every thing on your monstrous plan for the day, you are setting yourself up for disappointment. This is for what reason I\u2019m a major devotee to concentrating my time on the most significant assignment first. Sometimes we get confused, we have some much tasks to complete throughout the day. One tips for you, is to organize them. Probably you\u2019re asking how can I do it. **The solution is Eisenhower Box.** **Eisenhower Box is** one of the best productivity tools that will help to structure your task In order of priority, and urgency, so you can be able to save time, and energy. **3.Be More Mindful** With regards to completing things, one of the greatest difficulties that individuals face is having the option to concentrate on the job needing to be done. The brain is continually meandering, which implies that it\u2019s anything but difficult to get occupied. Stalling benefits from this state. So as to be productive, individuals expect that they must be always accomplishing and doing. The emphasis is dependably on the following thing that they have to do, or the following spot that they should be. Accordingly, they are never completely right now. #### 4.Say No Multitasking Our brain\u2019s marvelous. A lot of people think can do anything with it. Yes there\u2019s some kind truth to that, but when it comes to multitasking, it\u2019s a bad server. Our focus is severely limited, and when we try to focus on different tasks, you know what happens: Our attention go all over the place, we become agitated, confused, and nothing is done at the end. To get things done quickly, effectively, do one thing at one, then move on to the other one, and so forth. #### 5.Manage and relief stress. Since stress can cause physical, enthusiastic, and conduct issues \u2013 which can affect your well being, vitality, prosperity, and mental sharpness \u2013 it\u2019s nothing unexpected that pressure frustrates your work execution.

of my looks. \nI lost about 30kg (66 pounds) since 2019. I look way better. People treat me better and life is just way more pleasant. \nFinancially I\u2019m in a very good place after being broke and living with my parents for years.\n\nBut still I\u2019m not happy! I realized the only way I\u2019m going to be REALLY happy is when I conquer my inner demons. Everyone around me look like models, instagram influencers, bodybuilders. 3 of my friends are actual models for brands. One of them is a dancer. \n\nI notice how they get treated.. people respect them immediately. Without saying a word, when they enter the room people are either happy or shocked to see them. Then I see the same people (who paid me dust and were not really interested in me) go out of their way to impress them, or start a conversation with them. Then they seem shocked that the most attractive people at the party are actually my best friends. \n\nFor example, the dancer of the group (a gorgeous olive skinned latina girl with long dark hair and a body like Kim Kardashian, face like Bella Hadid) was with me the entire evening. If she needed to go to the toilet she would grab me. During the entire party she would hug me, kiss me on the cheek and grab drinks for me. People were giving her compliments.. but I could see them looking and thinking.. why is she with this chubby black dude? \n\nI dont want to be the ugly one in the group anymore. I feel like everyone in my friend group is a solid 8,5 and I\u2019m a 4 in the looks department.\n\nMentally I\u2019m about 6/10. Few years ago it was 3/10. 10 being perfect. I will never reach a 10 mentally.. 8.5 - 9 is what I\u2019m aiming for. \nI\u2019m improving every day. Weightloss really helped change my entire life. \nPersonality. People that know me for years absolutely adore me.. I am a great friend, funny, smart, I always help people, I uplift everybody. I have helped a few friends financially, giving them advice. Also mentally. Sending them books for self improvement. \n\nSo I gained about 6kg (13 pounds) and my face is fuller. I absolutely hate it. I\u2019m still considered \u201cbig\u201d .. I\u2019m not in the extreme ugly obese phase like back in the day, but I\u2019m still \u201cchubby\u201d \n\nFinancially, spiritually and mentally I\u2019m on the right track! But it\u2019s just the looks! My looks do NOT MATCH THE WAY I FEEL INSIDE! \nI want to lose atleast another 30kg. (66pounds) in the next 6 months. I know 100% if I do this.. my life will be amazing! Because all my problems are associated with my looks. \nPeople tend to be nicer to people that look good.. \nsince I lost 30kg I\u2019ve been invited to more parties in 2020 and 2021 than 2014 till 2019 combined. In 2019 I was MIA from May till October. I cut everyone off and just continued to work on myself. Lost 21 pounds in the first month! Now I cant even complete 30 days of clean eating and going to the gym.. \nI\u2019m starting today.. I have to lose this weight.. I\u2019m tired of being the chubby big friend. Yes I look much better and I get more attention.. but I still feel like I\u2019m the odd one out. \n\nI want to change as a person. Completely. If I could \u201ckill\u201d myself and come back as a new person I would! I do not like alot of things about myself.. and I have to change that ASAP. \nI\u2019m going to rebuild myself into the person I see!\n\nEDIT: Deleted some stuff, my apologies for coming off as bragging.", "author_fullname": "t2_7h0swudv", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "If I change my looks, Life will be easier.", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/selfimprovement", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_rup794", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 23, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 23, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1641200520.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1641173205.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.selfimprovement", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;26 Male&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I  just realized the reason why I\u2019m not reaching my full potential is because of my looks. \nI lost about 30kg (66 pounds) since 2019.

People were giving her compliments.. but I could see them looking and thinking.. why is she with this chubby black dude? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dont want to be the ugly one in the group anymore. I feel like everyone in my friend group is a solid 8,5 and I\u2019m a 4 in the looks department.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mentally I\u2019m about 6/10. Few years ago it was 3/10. 10 being perfect. I will never reach a 10 mentally.. 8.5 - 9 is what I\u2019m aiming for. \nI\u2019m improving every day. Weightloss really helped change my entire life. \nPersonality. People that know me for years absolutely adore me.. I am a great friend, funny, smart, I always help people, I uplift everybody. I have helped a few friends financially, giving them advice. Also mentally. Sending them books for self improvement. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I gained about 6kg (13 pounds) and my face is fuller. I absolutely hate it. I\u2019m still considered \u201cbig\u201d .. I\u2019m not in the extreme ugly obese phase like back in the day, but I\u2019m still \u201cchubby\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Financially, spiritually and mentally I\u2019m on the right track! But it\u2019s just the looks! My looks do NOT MATCH THE WAY I FEEL INSIDE! \nI want to lose atleast another 30kg. (66pounds) in the next 6 months. I know 100% if I do this.. my life will be amazing! Because all my problems are associated with my looks. \nPeople tend to be nicer to people that look good.. \nsince I lost 30kg I\u2019ve been invited to more parties in 2020 and 2021 than 2014 till 2019 combined. In 2019 I was MIA from May till October. I cut everyone off and just continued to work on myself. Lost 21 pounds in the first month! Now I cant even complete 30 days of clean eating and going to the gym.. \nI\u2019m starting today.. I have to lose this weight.. I\u2019m tired of being the chubby big friend. Yes I look much better and I get more attention.. but I still feel like I\u2019m the odd one out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to change as a person. Completely. If I could \u201ckill\u201d myself and come back as a new person I would! I do not like alot of things about myself.. and I have to change that ASAP. \nI\u2019m going to rebuild myself into the person I see!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Deleted some stuff, my apologies for coming off as bragging.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmbm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "rup794", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MajesticBoy20", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 27, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfimprovement/comments/rup794/if_i_change_my_looks_life_will_be_easier/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/rup794/if_i_change_my_looks_life_will_be_easier/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1352066, "created_utc": 1641173205.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfimprovement", "selftext": "shxhxn\\_76", "author_fullname": "t2_se4l87al", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Isn't it appealing that God created mountains, planets, galaxies and many more beautiful things that he saw purpose in you too, that's why your here, existing, reading this right now.

I have this sick addiction of having sex with NEW women, it\u2019s always in my head and its impacting my life.\n\nI\u2019ve also been a solitary individual where most of my social life is women, I don\u2019t have many male friends and I can\u2019t seem to make ones that last, we always drift apart.\n\nContemplating this has left me to think that I am compensating the lack of social life with dating and sex, and the lack of dopamine from stimulators such as going out, accomplishments or working out with masturbation.\n\nThis might sound silly but I can\u2019t stop, I tried letting go but I always fail to not masturbate for more than 24 hours.\n\nAny similar stories or help?

But I\u2019m just tired, tired of getting 0 matches on dating apps, of putting myself out there and being 23 and never being on a single date or had sex yet. \n\nI wanted to be enough. Wanted to take a girl out on fun dates, cook for her, be a part of her life, watch movies and cuddle, make sure she knows she\u2019s amazing when she needs it. But girls don\u2019t want that. \n\nAll that\u2019s stuff is bs. Maybe in the 90s but not now.

Not long after, I was devastated and could not understand where I went wrong. After a few weeks, I managed to muster up the motivation to try again and say \u201cthis time I will succeed\u201d. I won the fight every day for two months. In the third month, I failed yet again.\n\nThis went on over and over again for six years.\n\nThat is, after six years of painfully searching for a solution and almost coming to my wit's end, I finally said \u201cnever again\u201d. Since then, my prior addiction to porn has no longer haunted me.\n\nAs I reflect back on my journey, there are many things I learned about myself and the rules that must be applied to succeed.\n\nThe first rule that all of you must understand is related to your thinking. It took me investigating and reading books and self-help topics from 50 to over 100 years ago to learn this. Let us analyze this a little further.\n\nAddiction to porn, or anything for that matter starts with the mind. After six years, I noticed a pattern. If I thought about porn even for a split second, I had a hard time removing that thought. As a result, my mind was constantly thinking about porn. Since it was too hard to stop, I never really tried. That was my first mistake.\n\nThinking about porn increased my desire to consume it. That\u2019s when I learned that desire often stems from your thoughts. That\u2019s rule number two. If you think back on your life, your desire to successfully pass an examination, for example, stems from your thoughts on it.\n\nWanting to watch porn is no different. But there\u2019s more\u2026\n\nOften the cause of many relapses was because of these thoughts I had. But what made me think this way? Why did these thoughts keep coming back?\n\nPut simply, the environment we live in encourages moral degradation. People no longer value modesty and self-respect, instead, they classify it as oppressive. As a result, our society is rampant with the objectification and sexual glorification of women and men. There was a time when dressing modestly was respectable, but today, nakedness is not only applauded but encouraged.\n\nAs a result, young men, women, and children are now being exposed to our highly immodest society. Social media amplifies this issue\u2026it won\u2019t be long before I think that porn becomes an acceptable norm in social media. We are headed in that direction regardless.\n\nIf this is the environment we grow up in, then it becomes well-suited for getting people addicted to porn. Unless you\u2019re in strict control of your thoughts, a simple peek or glance, even an accidental one can set you back to ground zero.\n\nRule number three: you need to start removing the thoughts about porn like you remove weeds in your garden. In its place, you\u2019ll need to plant thoughts on being successful against your porn addiction.\n\nThat is not all, but one small step at a time, you also need to control your social media usage and where your gaze wanders. At the beginning of this war on porn, strict self-denial is necessary in order to have a chance of winning. You\u2019ll need to detoxify your mind from what you desire.\n\nPractice these techniques, remove social media, and avoid temptations like the plague. In the morning, and before bed, you need to imagine yourself having overcome porn and that you are enjoying life without it controlling you. Visualize the scenes, the feeling, and the happiness. Believe very strictly that you have the capacity to overcome porn. Each and every one of you do!\n\nOnce your mind is cleansed of this filth, you truly believe in yourself, the desire to fight porn is stronger than the desire to consume it, and you have practiced strict self-denial, then, the strength of your will is going to carry you forward.\n\nOnce you have conquered porn, you will still need to be careful and be on guard 24/7 and 365 days a year. I made this mistake and it cost me greatly.\n\nHowever, it gets easier because once you have overcome porn, then accidental glances and other occurrences do not affect you for you have already conquered your mind. Only, be watchful of your thoughts.\n\nThe moment you think wrong, burn it from your memory before it burns you back to the ground.\n\nIn conclusion, I recommend you all read the book \u201cAs a Man Thinketh\u201d by James Allen.

It started by feeling sick eating out at restaurants then turned into avoiding any kind of social gathering. This meant kids parties, adult parties, meals with friends, family, drinks, days out etc.\n\nDuring this period, I was never unhappy. There would be times where I'd see a party going ahead on social media and feel sad that I wasn't going, yet the short-term relief of not having to deal with the anxiety was enough to justify my decision not to go. I had quite a few friends at school, I'd say I was pretty much friends with everyone yet I always felt on the edge of groups. I think that's the social anxiety aspect, as I was always invited to things (despite never going) which showed people did like me.\n\nOver the school years and then into university I became more and more recluse. I commuted to university because I was too anxious to live there. I remember 'bragging' to my parents that I was only going to university to get a degree and that's it. I didn't want to make friends. A friend would mean another person to judge me or someone that would invite me to things. Again, I didn't see this as a red flag (neither did my parents). I just always thought that when I leave university, I'll get the career I want and that's the time I'll make friends. I'd always delay it. My weekends were spent either studying, hobbies (I could do on my own) or just with my parents. I met up with friends probably 5-6 times a year.\n\nI graduated top of my class and got offered a job straight in the industry. Wow! I'd always wanted be in the industry that I'm in, since I was about 7 years old. The pandemic had just started, and I was instructed to work from home. Everyone was in the same position, and I felt like my introvert nature was a superpower. Being stuck at home and not having to go out? Yes please! Previously I'd looked at people who went partying and socialising all the time as strange. My mum and dad don't have a particularly rich social life, so I think I assumed that we were normal and everyone else was weird. I looked at young people my age, and thought what are you doing with your life? Is life really about just partying? What about your careers?\n\nMy graduation got delayed until late 2021 and when I went it suddenly hit me. I was there, with my parents, whilst everyone was taking photos with people that they'll probably be life-long friends with. I'd made a couple of friends at university (one in particular), but the rest were just acquaintances. Even the main friend I made lives far away and I haven't met up with him for a couple years. We message probably once every 6 months at most.\n\nI suddenly realised how far behind I was socially. I'd thought my anxiety / social skills would be like a switch. Once I wanted to socialise, I could just do it. However, now I realise that there's so many things I can't do. This was highlighted to me most when I wanted to start dating, having never had a girlfriend before. I went on my first date in January. She was incredibly sweet and we got on really well but I kept finding either flaws in her or myself. If they want to go out with me they're probably weird or they just don't know how weird I am yet. \n\nBefore meeting her, I'd never been to restaurant with friends, gone for drinks, travelled on my own etc. So now I want to date, I realise these are all new experiences that to most people are just easy. I've never been on a day out with friends so how do I suddenly do that with a girl?\n\nI feared judgement so much, that I avoided any situation in which I could be made fun of. This led to a decade of avoiding social events. I'd justify it by saying that I didn't want to do these things anyway. Which is partly true, but also quite sad. I've never really seized life, any new experience is a worry.\n\nThese weren't my later years I missed out on, this was my prime youth (13-23). The time that shapes you. I'm an old person stuck inside a young person's body. Partly because my main social group after I left school was my parents and so whatever their view of the world, was kinda mine. Now I realise, that I wasted my youth and I want to get out there, I feel like I can't. I don't have a stable sense of who I am anymore. People my age have their individual hobbies, quirks, stable sense of self. \n\nI'm not good at socialising, because I haven't practiced.
