Now Porn is a topic which many people in our society don\u2019t like to discuss, but hide, like its something that should be hidden to the general public, when generally a lot of people watch it and consume it on daily basis and I think it should be brought to the forefront because its extremely wrong the kinds of porn that the industry promotes and the effect that this has on young people to this day and the effect that it has had on people\u2019s lives, especially young people.\n\nThe porn industry needs a major shift because the kinds of things that it promotes just isn\u2019t righteous, things such as adultery which destroy families and ruin family life just isn\u2019t right and the fact that mainstream porn industries promote this is very sinful in my eyes.\n\nBut the effect it had on young people including myself will last people a lifetime and has had a major impact on society in terms of people\u2019s mental health, wellbeing and spiritual development and development as people.\n\nIt promotes these sinful scenarios and incest porn such as \u201cstep moms\u201d, \u201cstep sisters\u201d, \u201cdaughter swaps\u201d, \u201cstep dads\u201d, \u201cstep brothers\u201d who have sex with each other and it effects people psychologically, mentally and emotionally and effects society as a whole. Of course, most of them are not actually real \u201cstep moms\u201d, \u201cstep sisters\u201d, \u201cstep dads\u201d and \u201cstep brothers\u201d, but it promotes to young people this kind of thing, which I think is a grievous sin towards God and his kingdom and something needs to change in the porn industry as a whole and in society.\n\nIt promotes sin in terms of making young people lustful towards \u201cporn actresses\u201d, making them believe that things like adultery are normal in our society and of course they almost certainly are not. I guess because young people grow up in this environment where they watch these sinful acts which are promoted by the porn industry, and it encourages them to believe that this is completely acceptable and normal things like adultery and these really unusual and weird scenarios which just don\u2019t happen in the real world with actual loving and caring couples who have lived together for decades who servants of God are.\n\nI think the solution is to make people recognize, especially young people and the porn industry itself the wrongdoings that they do and the effect that it has in our society, especially to young people and young adults such as myself who has watched such sinful acts and videos for so long.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that the solution to any issue in society is to first raise awareness to the general public and the people actually effected by it especially on why its so wrong and evil. The porn industry as a whole needs major reform and laws and regulations need to be put in place which stop the promotion of such sinful acts such as adultery and the young people that consume this kinds of content need to stop watching this content, but of course this is very difficult to do when its so heavily pushed this kind of content onto young people, therefore only until Governments start to act in accordance with God and start to actually take action to help young people across the globe stop watching these kinds of sinful content online is when we can start to see a shift in the mental health and wellbeing of young people in our society and instead promote normal and happy loving and caring families in our society, because what the porn industry as a whole promotes is extremely wrong and sinful and goes against the ten commandments, thou shall not lie (lying about them being \u201cstep moms\u201d), thou shall not kill (\u201ckilling family life, killing happily married couples, killing what could have been happily married, loving caring couples), thou shall not steal (\u201cstealing what could have been loving and caring couples), thou shall not serve any other God before me (\u201cServing dubious masters who don\u2019t have societies best interests), thou shall honor your father and mother (promoting discontent with mother and father, through incest porn) thou shall not commit adultery (incest porn), Thou shall not make idols (promoting through masturbation worship to these sinful people in the industry as a whole), thou shall not covet (promoting lust to people). So, in total 8 of the 10 commandments are broken and it\u2019s a grievous sin to break that many of the ten commandment and goes very much against God and his wishes for humanity. Hence why it\u2019s important that young people are brought awareness to this issue and why it\u2019s important that adults who should know better than young people do more about this, because in my eyes its an abomination to the concept of God the whole industry in porn and the fact that Governments around the world are actually complacent in this, and only until we as individuals start to take to thing such as meditation, prayer and service to God can things begin to change in society as a whole and the porn industry can begin to change as a whole.", "author_fullname": "t2_f5bpu4pa", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Stop Watching Porn", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/selfimprovement", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_tg59fj", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.61, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 109, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 109, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1647505051.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.selfimprovement", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article I will talk a little about Porn.

It is not just the act of saying something that one knows to be false, it is also the act of withholding information that one knows to be true.\n\nThe techniques used to detect lies are:\n\n1) Psychological Analysis\n\n2) Verbal Analysis\n\n3) Nonverbal Analysis\n\n4) Lying by omission\n\n### what are the lie Detection Steps and Tips\n\nLie detection is a process of identifying the truth from the lie. It is not always easy to detect lies and there are many factors that can make it difficult.\n\nThe most important step in lie detection is to create an environment where people feel safe enough to tell the truth. There are some tips that can help you do this:\n\n\\- Make sure you have a good understanding of the topic and ask open-ended questions. - Sometimes people might need time to think about their answer so give them time. - Ask them to tell you more about what they said or what they did when it happened, not just what happened next or how they felt at the time. - Ask them if they have any other thoughts or reasons for doing or saying something, even if it doesn 't seem relevant to the topic.\n\n\\- Ask them if they wanted to lie or do something different that you might be surprised by.\n\nKeep in mind that liars often try to avoid eye contact and make them feel uncomfortable by asking too many questions about what other people think of their answer.\n\nRemember that there is no such thing as a \"lie perfect,\"\n\n### What a Person's Body Language Says About Lying\n\nBody language is a great way to tell if someone is lying to you or not.\n\nSome of the common signs that indicate that someone is lying are:\n\nThey will avoid eye contact with you, and will move their eye pills to the upper left.\n\nThey might touch their mouth, nose or ears while speaking.\n\nThey will keep moving their hands beside their heads and the ears.\n\nTheir voice might be shaky or they might stutter when they speak.\n\n### What are the 2 Main Types of Lies and Why Do They Differ?\n\nThere are 2 main types of lies: white lies and malicious lies.\n\nWhite lies are meant to protect the feelings of someone and malicious lies are meant to cause harm.\n\n**White Lies:** are used to make people feel good about themselves and their actions. They are often used for self-preservation as well as other's preservation. For example, when someone asks you how they look in a dress that they just bought, you might say that they look great even if the dress is not flattering on them because you don't want to hurt their feelings or make them feel bad about their purchase.\n\n**Malicious Lies:** Malicious liars use deception for personal gain or amusement at another\u2019s expense by telling a lie that will hurt the target of the lie. For example, if someone lies to get a date with a person they\u2019re attracted to, or lies about having money so they can pass it off as an inheritance.\n\n### How Does the Biological Basis for Lying Work?\n\nLying is a very complicated process that has both biological and environmental influences. The brain sends signals to the vocal cords and muscles, which are responsible for the production of speech. The prefrontal cortex is also involved in lying. This area of the brain is able to control emotional reactions and impulses, as well as regulate behavior. Lying can be considered a complex process because it involves many different parts of the brain, not just one or two.\n\nThe prefrontal cortex is an important part of this process because it regulates our impulses and emotions when we are lying. It can also control behavior during these times. When people lie, they tend to have an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, which are signs that their body may be trying to respond to stressors that they feel while lying.\n\n### 3 Simple Ways to Tell If Someone is Lying to You\n\n1) The best way to tell if someone is lying is by looking at their body language. For example, they might not make eye contact with you or they might fidget a lot.\n\n2) Another way to tell if someone is lying is by listening to what they are saying and observing how they say it. If the person\u2019s voice sounds shaky or unnatural, then it could be a sign of deception.\n\n3) The third way to tell if someone is lying is through their facial expressions and emotions. For example, if the person has an expression of fear on their face, but they are telling you that everything\u2019s fine, then there\u2019s a good chance that they lie.\n\n### 3 Exercises to Help You Understand Lying Better by Learning to Read People's Emotions\n\nThere are many ways to detect a lie, but the easiest and most effective way is by reading people's emotions.\n\nThe first exercise is called \"The Eyes Have It.\" In this exercise, you will go through a series of pictures and try to figure out if the person in the picture is telling the truth or not.\n\nThe second exercise is called \"The 3-2-1 Exercise.\" In this exercise, you will watch a video of someone telling a story and try to identify when they are lying.\n\nFinally, the third exercise is called \"The Lying Game.\" This game has two people who take turns asking each other questions that they have to answer truthfully. The goal of this game is for one person to get their partner to lie while they don't tell any lies themselves.", "author_fullname": "t2_pnk9p468", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How to easily detect whether someone is lying to you", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/selfimprovement", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_xr55hp", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.47, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tips and Tricks", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "nsfw", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1664450345.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 3, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.selfimprovement", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;What are the Techniques used to Help You to Detect Lies&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lying is a way of life.

I'm a 25yr old guy and I have always been complimented my entire life. My entire childhood were adults saying I was extremely cute and that I would get \"all the girls\" later in my life. This actually continued during my teenage years where people just kept complimenting me, people also offering me model jobs etc. I was always the popular kid in school, pretty much got handed everything because of how I look. I never finished high school and I have a pretty good job and income, all part of basically how I look.\n\nPeople always try and suck up to me and basically want to be me, the tricky part is that i'm super self aware by this point by all of it and how good I look. The thing is, people have been commenting on it, which they didn't use to do.

These last 3 years I'm just sitting at home and watching movies, scrolling social media and doing all sorts of things. every day I used to say to myself that I will change my life, I will become healthy, and I'm going to start tomorrow. but never did anything. I'm a complete failure in life. I'm from India, and in here getting a job is not easy because of the huge unemployment issue.  Whenever I saw someone successful I try to look for how old they are and start comparing if we are similar age then I feel very very depressed and if they are 3-4 years or more elder than me then I feel okay I still got time. I can achieve that. But in actual life, I'm not doing anything, and I know that I'm too afraid to start something, I am from a rural area and also don't have the confidence to talk to city people because I feel they are too smart.  \n For the last 9 months, I have listened to countless podcasts, watched lots of interviews and created some great useful notes, honestly if somebody wants to do something this notebook will help them a lot because I make it very briefly and it is useful. But I'm not able to do anything because I have never done anything in life.

What do I have to lose? This is 1. some of the information the guy says in his videos summarized (in quote boxes) and 2. my commentary and thoughts on it (normal text)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Think about how ridiculous it is to go out in the public (where there's other people) and put headphones over your ears, blocking out one of your senses.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Would you go out and stuff your ears with earplugs? Wear noise cancelling earplugs to the gym, to school, to the library, in the grocery store. No. That's weird. The fact that they now also play music instead of just blocking other sounds is irrelevant. You are shutting off your senses.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You are missing opportunities just because you want to listen to some rap lyrics. A potential best friend walks past you but you don't talk to them because you are stuck in your own music bubble. A potential girlfriend sits next to you but you don't notice them becasue you're listening to the same song you've heard 1000 times already.\n\nWould you go out wearing a blindfold to not see anything? With a clothes pin on your nose to block out smells? Do you see how ridiculous it would be to block out any of your other senses in public? The only difference is that blocking out your auditory perception is more socially accepted than blocking your visual or olfactory perception.\n\n&gt;\"*But I want to wear them at the gym, so I don't get distracted and can lift heavy weights!!*\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Your mindset is greater than music, and you're coping, because you've been living for years letting music fuel you.\n\nIf you have to rely on music to train hard or study, you aren't capable of training hard or studying. Music is a drug. Imagine doing this for any other drug.\n\n\"*I can concentrate and work hard the entire day as long as I take adderall*\" So you can't contentrate and work hard the entire day. Being able to do something only with performance enhancing drugs means you can't do that thing.\n\n&gt;If you have trouble going to the gym without headphones, it's because you don't want to go to the gym. You want this sort of rave in your head with loud music and songs, and the gym is just where that happens. But if you go to the gym just to listen to music, you're not training your discipline. The gym just becomes another high dopamine instant gratification activity. Yes, physically you'll become stronger, but you'll lose out on all the mental benefits.\n\nWhat's next? Now you put on headphones. In a few years you're going to go outside wearing AR glasses, to modify what you see to turn reality even more into your own bubble, secluding you from the outside world. In a few decades you're going to go outside wearing a VR headset, with haptic feedback, and smell, and taste, and you will be living entirely inside your own bubble.\n\nTry it. Stop wearing headphones for a month and look at the results. You will encounter opportunities, you will talk to people, people will talk to you, it's great.\n\nI've had good results, within a few weeks of not wearing headphones I've already had 3 people talk to me in the gym, yes it was very short small talk of a few sentences, but if I talk to 1 person every week due to not wearing headphones, that's 52 a year, and if there's a 1/50 chance it actually becomes a friendship, that's still like 1 new friend a year.\n\nAlso outside. Instead of living in my own reality, listening to music, I actually live in the moment. Look around me. Make eye contact with people. I've had so many positive interactions. At the grocery store, walking past a girl, normally I'd be listening to music and I'd try to avoid eye contact because I was listening to music, now I don't have music. So I look at her and smile. And she smiles back. We didn't talk, but I can imagine that if 1/10 of these interactions lead to actually talking, and 1/10 of those lead to something like a friendship or relationship... over the course of a lifetime it would have major consequences, to have 1 of these interactions every week.\n\n&gt;Do this. Be more attentive to the people you normally see. The girl that works at the front desk? Now you can't ignore her under the guise of wearing headphones. Say hi to her. Or maybe even give her a compliment. Give everyone a compliment, give a guy a compliment too. That's how you make people feel better. If someone gives me a compliment, I love that, it makes me feel good. Why shouldn't I do the same to other people? It's free, it doesn't take anything, takes a quick thought, a little sound out of my mouth, that's magic, it's an incantation. I can say a sound and it can change the way their energy is. That's high thumos. Like, are you kidding me? Notice your power. Stop blocking off a sense, stop wearing headphones. Use your senses. Use your body, and your voice, and get out there, and speak fire, and speak life, and illuminate this dread that everyone's in. It's up to you, it's up to me.

What do I have to lose? This is 1. some of the information the guy says in his videos summarized (in quote boxes) and 2. my commentary and thoughts on it (normal text)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Think about how ridiculous it is to go out in the public (where there&amp;#39;s other people) and put headphones over your ears, blocking out one of your senses.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would you go out and stuff your ears with earplugs? Wear noise cancelling earplugs to the gym, to school, to the library, in the grocery store. No. That&amp;#39;s weird. The fact that they now also play music instead of just blocking other sounds is irrelevant. You are shutting off your senses.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are missing opportunities just because you want to listen to some rap lyrics. A potential best friend walks past you but you don&amp;#39;t talk to them because you are stuck in your own music bubble. A potential girlfriend sits next to you but you don&amp;#39;t notice them becasue you&amp;#39;re listening to the same song you&amp;#39;ve heard 1000 times already.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would you go out wearing a blindfold to not see anything? With a clothes pin on your nose to block out smells? Do you see how ridiculous it would be to block out any of your other senses in public? The only difference is that blocking out your auditory perception is more socially accepted than blocking your visual or olfactory perception.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;But I want to wear them at the gym, so I don&amp;#39;t get distracted and can lift heavy weights!!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your mindset is greater than music, and you&amp;#39;re coping, because you&amp;#39;ve been living for years letting music fuel you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have to rely on music to train hard or study, you aren&amp;#39;t capable of training hard or studying. Music is a drug. Imagine doing this for any other drug.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;I can concentrate and work hard the entire day as long as I take adderall&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; So you can&amp;#39;t contentrate and work hard the entire day. Being able to do something only with performance enhancing drugs means you can&amp;#39;t do that thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you have trouble going to the gym without headphones, it&amp;#39;s because you don&amp;#39;t want to go to the gym. You want this sort of rave in your head with loud music and songs, and the gym is just where that happens. But if you go to the gym just to listen to music, you&amp;#39;re not training your discipline. The gym just becomes another high dopamine instant gratification activity. Yes, physically you&amp;#39;ll become stronger, but you&amp;#39;ll lose out on all the mental benefits.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s next? Now you put on headphones. In a few years you&amp;#39;re going to go outside wearing AR glasses, to modify what you see to turn reality even more into your own bubble, secluding you from the outside world. In a few decades you&amp;#39;re going to go outside wearing a VR headset, with haptic feedback, and smell, and taste, and you will be living entirely inside your own bubble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try it. Stop wearing headphones for a month and look at the results. You will encounter opportunities, you will talk to people, people will talk to you, it&amp;#39;s great.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had good results, within a few weeks of not wearing headphones I&amp;#39;ve already had 3 people talk to me in the gym, yes it was very short small talk of a few sentences, but if I talk to 1 person every week due to not wearing headphones, that&amp;#39;s 52 a year, and if there&amp;#39;s a 1/50 chance it actually becomes a friendship, that&amp;#39;s still like 1 new friend a year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also outside.

Hindus believe that karma is the sum of one's actions during their lifetime. Karma can be good or bad. The law of karma states that if someone does good deeds then they will have good karma and if they do bad deeds then they will have bad karma.\n\nThe idea behind this was to encourage people to do good deeds because if you do them with a pure heart then you will be rewarded for them in your next life.\n\n### What is the defination of karmic balance?\n\nKarmic balance is the idea that people are rewarded with good karma and bad karma for their actions.\n\nKarma is a Sanskrit term, meaning \"action or deed.\" Karma is the law of cause and effect. Karma is the spiritual principle of cause and effect. Your actions - your deeds - are the causes from which your future happiness or unhappiness will come.\n\n### 3 Ways to Live with Karma and Cultivate Positive Karmic Energy in Your Life Everyday\n\nEach day, we make decisions that affect our karma. For example, if you are feeling angry and lash out at someone, it may cause negative karma. However, if you make a conscious decision to be kind and compassionate to others and offer your help when needed, it will have positive karma.\n\nThere are three ways to live with karma in your life everyday:\n\n1) Live with the intention of not hurting anyone\n\n2) Live with the intention of helping as much as possible\n\n3) Live with the intention of being kind to yourself\n\n### How to Utilize Your Surplus and Avoid Losing Your life Balance\n\nIn today\u2019s society, we are faced with the constant pressure to do more and more. This is something that is not going away anytime soon. The key to maintaining a healthy work-life balance is to have a surplus of energy and time in one area so that you can focus on the other.\n\nThis means that if you have a surplus of energy, then you can focus on your work by working harder and longer hours. Conversely, if you have a surplus of time, then you should be able to spend your time outside of work doing things like spending time with friends or family or exercising.\n\nThere are many ways in which we can create this surplus including sleep, exercise, meditation, mindfulness and getting enough restful sleep each night.\n\nHowever, it is important to remember that there are times when it is necessary for us to put in extra hours at the office or spend more time working at home if we want to get ahead in our careers.\n\nAll of the above is leading to better karma, and it's much better to help and add value to people. It'll impact your life in a good way!\n\nYou should think about what's more important: your work or your life. If you see that your work is taking away from other aspects of your life then it may be a good idea to let go of some aspects of your job and vice versa.\n\n### 9 Reasons Why You Should Consider Karma While Living Your Life\n\nKarma includes the concept that our lives are shaped by our past actions and that the consequences of those actions can be experienced in this life or in a future life.\n\nThe following are nine reasons why you should consider karma while living your life:\n\n1- Your past karma will shape your future karma.\n\n2- What you put out into the world will come back to you.\n\n3- You cannot escape from your bad karma.\n\n4- Karma is about accepting responsibility for what you've done and making amends for it.\n\n5- Karma is about being mindful of what you say and do to others because it will come back to you  - The universe has a way of balancing things out when we act with kindness, good intentions, and honesty.\n\n6- The universe will always balance things out if we act with kindness and good intentions.\n\n7- Karma is about seeing your life as a school run by the cosmic teacher - The universe is teaching us lessons that we need to learn in order to grow personally.\n\n8- Karma is about being open to receiving what the cosmic world has for you.\n\n9- There are many ways that karma can play out in our lives so keep your eyes and ears open!\n\n### Conclusion: Why You Should Consider Karma While Living Your Life\n\nThe bottom line, if you do good and think good thoughts, you'll attract more happiness and wins around you and vice versa.", "author_fullname": "t2_pnk9p468", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Why you should consider karma while living your life", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/selfimprovement", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_yamtwv", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.46, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tips and Tricks", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "spoiler", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1666442674.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.selfimprovement", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is Karma?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Karma is a Sanskrit word that means &amp;quot;action, work or deed; it also refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Karma is a major concept in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism and Taoism.

If you see that your work is taking away from other aspects of your life then it may be a good idea to let go of some aspects of your job and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;9 Reasons Why You Should Consider Karma While Living Your Life&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Karma includes the concept that our lives are shaped by our past actions and that the consequences of those actions can be experienced in this life or in a future life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The following are nine reasons why you should consider karma while living your life:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1- Your past karma will shape your future karma.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2- What you put out into the world will come back to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3- You cannot escape from your bad karma.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4- Karma is about accepting responsibility for what you&amp;#39;ve done and making amends for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5- Karma is about being mindful of what you say and do to others because it will come back to you  - The universe has a way of balancing things out when we act with kindness, good intentions, and honesty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6- The universe will always balance things out if we act with kindness and good intentions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7- Karma is about seeing your life as a school run by the cosmic teacher - The universe is teaching us lessons that we need to learn in order to grow personally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8- Karma is about being open to receiving what the cosmic world has for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;9- There are many ways that karma can play out in our lives so keep your eyes and ears open!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion: Why You Should Consider Karma While Living Your Life&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bottom line, if you do good and think good thoughts, you&amp;#39;ll attract more happiness and wins around you and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "8723247e-1e96-11ed-94d7-0eabd5e537a3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": true, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmbm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#ffb000", "id": "yamtwv", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Viral-conclusionz8", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 3, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfimprovement/comments/yamtwv/why_you_should_consider_karma_while_living_your/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/yamtwv/why_you_should_consider_karma_while_living_your/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1352066, "created_utc": 1666442674.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfimprovement", "selftext": "I\u2019ve been really struggling since 2018 and have been slowly declining.

and the local action plans that will enable those global outcomes. \n\nI am very proud of this fact, and I am starting to accumulate certain amounts of free cash. I have 2 ideas on how I can potentially convert that idle cash into productive assets (among them is purchasing an in-demand tile cutter and renting it so that I can get to the break-even point and then basically receive the free profits for years to come. The cutter costs $2K.). \n\nBut, today, I decided to read up on the overall concept of having a life plan, and there were several people on Quora and online that said the following: \n\n* Neither Steve Jobs nor Mark Zuckerberg had a clear life plan before they set up their businesses. \n* They were driven by spontaneity and they just did something to succeed in the lives. \n* Digging deeper, we can uncover what exactly it was that they in order to succeed, and that was \"(a) identify a huge gap in the market (where there's a lot of latent demand for a product/service, and there's no supply - or the supply is coming there, but it hasn't come there yet), (b) swoop in and launch a service that satiates this need, (c) experience the explosive growth. \n* In particular, we would not be talking about these two individuals if (c) hadn't transpired. Compare them with any farmer, who makes a stable income and who is proud of their work and contribution to the society. \n* Thus, the commenters like that state that it's actually a bad thing to set up and deliver on the long-term and strategic plans as you might miss huge opportunities as you move through your lifeterm. And if you don't have those plans, you will be receptive to new opportunities. \n* (such commenters never talk about this point) Then, allegedly, you are going to take advantage of those opportunities and hit a jackpot. YOU CAN DO THIS!!! But, those people never say this, its me kinda extending their narrative. They never about this because whenever you say a statement like this, the interloculator can easily turn the tables on the you and ask you directly \"are you taking advantage of those huge opportunities?\". If you say \"no\", then your interlocutor would immediately  assign you to the group \"talkers-not-doers\" - if the interlocutor is smart enough. If they are stupid, they are going to continue listening to you. This is how crypto gurus and the latest sellers of idiotic diets rise up.\n\n**What do you think about this?** \n\nHere's my opinion: \n\n1. I am clearly bumping into a need to categorize all of the people into several groups: \n\na. **People who don't have a plan and who ridicule those who do have a plan**. Such people are a very bad influence on you - and on me - as they seek to undermine our strive to fix our lives, get rich and happy. I don't want to be a person like that, and I don't want to surround myself with people like this. I am not in this group. \n\n**b. People who have a very basic life plan, and who are not trying to get successful.** Successful = trying to reach 1million in the assets. The people in this group usually work in stores, construction and agriculture. They are Homers. They won't make fun of your life plan - not because they like it, but because you won't talk to them about your plan. Imagine going into a local streapteash parlour and trying talking with men about their long-term financial vision. \n\n**c. People who have a strong life plan, and who realized that not everybody can become a Steve Jobs**. Such people understand that you ned to have a strong life plan. Just going to work at the local plant is a very weak strategy. Working as a content writer and slowly building you agency (this is what I am doing) is a much stronger strategy. People like this usually ask new acquitances about their life plans. If such a new connection says that \"life plans is for nerds, I live in the moment\", such people take a step back and move out of the relationship. This is a measure out of a necessity. You can see how I am writing and structuring my thoughts, right? Imagine talking to a Homer Simpson in this way. He would make fun of me and demotivate me, which might even result in me abandoning my life plan.  People in this group gradually become affluent. Sometimes, they are told that they need to be more creative and spontaneous. But, the talker is **ALMOST ALWAYS** unfavorable positioned in relation to them. For example, they go on a cruise with their wife, and there's a waiter there. When the waiter learns that they are in banking, they say \"maaaaan, you should invest in crypto, my man. I hear that crypto will kill off all banks. Aren't u afraid that you guys will get killed off. Man, crypto, is rad!!! If I were you...\". But ***THEY ARE NOT NEVER YOU***. The guy next to you is sipping a whiskey. You shake hands. In 6 months, he would call you and offer a better position in his department - he's a banker too. And the waiter? The waiter must have invested a lot of money into the crypto, and we know how that transpired for him. \n\n**d. People who have some kind of a plan, and then they go big**. This is Mark Zuckerber. When people say that Mark didn't have a plan, this is BS. He wasn't studying at a community college and working at a parking lot. He had the enablers in place. And he wasn't drinking vodka with the local goons either. When he saw the opportunity, he went after it and he made it big. In my life, I am planning to be writing for 3 years and constantly accumulate a lot of funds in the savings account. Subsequently, I plan to set up businesses and stat generating good passive profits. IN 10 years, I might just own 3 apartments, rent them out and generate a fully passive income stream. I understand that I am not a genius, but Steve Jobs was a genius. Was Steve Jobs a genius? I believe that he was. The man created Apple. Will I ever be able to create another Apple? Honestly, I don't know. I think that it's way too hard, and it's way much easier to work in my line of work. Also, I am not saying that I will always keep on working in writing, and I am interested in setting up various businesses. \n\n**What do you think about my position?**", "author_fullname": "t2_i6hwyvbm", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "If having a life plan is beneficial, how come Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg didn't have one.", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/selfimprovement", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_x1ezhg", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.47, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Question", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1661853510.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.selfimprovement", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am building out my life plan so that I can better manage both the global outcomes and the local action plans that will enable those global outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am very proud of this fact, and I am starting to accumulate certain amounts of free cash.

Why am I so impatient? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Literally my everyday routine is --&amp;gt;\nGo to class &amp;gt; come back home &amp;gt; use mobile, daydream television, &amp;gt; sleep. \nI hate this so much. My teacher is tired of me. My parents are tired of me. I myself am tired of me. I hate that people around me thinks I&amp;#39;m useless, but they are right. I hate the way I&amp;#39;m perceived. I know I myself can change it. But to think of how much time it&amp;#39;s gonna take is overwhelming. That&amp;#39;s why I don&amp;#39;t even want to start. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I make so many promises to myself and I dont keep them. I messed up my 7 daily tests because of procrastination. At every test, I thought I will do better. But I never did. Everytime one of my loved one says &amp;quot;You need to get rid of your bad habits&amp;quot;, I try to defend myself. But deep inside even I know they are right. And that really hurts. One one hand, I feel sad because of my poor routine, on the other hand I don&amp;#39;t have enough patience and energy to improve myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really want help. What should I do? It&amp;#39;s been a year and I am still where I started. I&amp;#39;m losing hope now&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "1bea587e-1e98-11ed-a645-26150c9d6f11", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmbm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#ff4500", "id": "ynite8", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Kaleidoscope3871", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 7, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfimprovement/comments/ynite8/im_a_lazy_coward_fuck_whos_completely_useless_and/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/ynite8/im_a_lazy_coward_fuck_whos_completely_useless_and/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1352066, "created_utc": 1667716497.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfimprovement", "selftext": " \n\nThe following is from a website I created to help all those in need of a push towards introspection/holistic health.

I went from drinking a cup a day, to most recently, 4 cups of espresso. It wasn\u2019t an activity associated with pleasure anymore, but rather a habit. A habit that if I broke, I knew what awaited me. Blistering headaches and a head fog.

I felt weak because of that. Reliant on a beverage to bring clarity and a better mood? Recently, I took a deep dive into stoicism and the scientifically backed data that aligned with its teachings. That helped me realize what I had done on two fronts.\n\nFor one, I developed a heavy tolerance to caffeine. A tolerance to the dopamine release that came from the one cup of coffee. An observable biological tolerance can be identified in as short as 3 days. How do you break a tolerance? Never becoming tolerant, random use or fasting.\n\nNow it\u2019s up to you how you go about that but I knew that I wanted to get this time in my life behind me ASAP so I did it cold-turkey. I knew I needed at least 10-14 days without any caffeine(the wash-out period). I substituted my coffee with a warm cup of herbal non-caffeinated tea and honey. The headaches came and went, the bitter mood, but that\u2019s it. About three days of withdrawal and it was all over. My sleep tremendously improved. And that\u2019s coming from someone who has never complained about my sleep. I always felt like I never had a problem sleeping, but during my caffeine fast it seemed like I needed less sleep.

The kick start, the clear mind, the good mood is all within. The coffee is just the unmasking of these qualities.

from the same cloth,\n\nAnd I will try to explain this as best as I can because it's not easy to explain.\n\nThis knowledge has to be gained by oneself.\n\nBut here we are...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor those who looked inside themselves, for those who tried to find themselves, for those who tried to know thyself,\n\nWhat did you find?\n\nDid you find yourself? I mean you as a person. In my case Teodor Zrinski.\n\nDid you find that guy there?\n\nI did not.\n\nWhat I found within myself is the universe, a pit without end, energy without bounds.\n\nI found many and lost the one, I thought I was.\n\nWhat I found out is there is no Teodor Zrinski...\n\nI mean there is, but there is not only Teodor but also everything else.\n\nI discovered a Universe inside me, \n\nA Universe inside a Universe.\n\n(they also say that human bodies resemble Universe planets, milky way and that shit)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou know there was this YouTuber (and many people like him), the guy who used to show abs on YouTube., forgot his name tho.

Jonny tried to stop him but got smashed in the head with a dumbbell. Cops were called and killed Jonny\u2019s dad. The death of his father liberated Jonny from always being scared and the need to protect his mom and his little brother.\n\nYou can see how his traumatic childhood shaped him to become a Navy Seal. Jonny always needed to protect his family and that carried over to protecting people in general. If he didn\u2019t have this painful childhood he probably woulnd\u2019t have achieved all the things he has so far.\n\nTough childhood create strong men, David Goggins and Elon Musk also had similar childhood with abusive father, caring mother and a brother.\n\n**Have one goal at a time**\n\nJonny never planned to become a Doctor or an Astronaut that all came later in his life. At age 18 all he wanted was to become a Navy SEAL. He says that you should have one goal at a time so you can go all in.\n\n**Assume that you are going to die**\n\nJonny was scared of dying on the battlefield, so he couldn't perform at his best and carry out his duties. To fix this, Jonny found it helpful to assume that he was going to die and he is not coming back home, this allowed him to act without fear and think more logically rather than letting emotion take over. How can we apply this to our daily life? Remembering that we all going to die is always a good reminder, as Steve Jobs said \u201cdeath is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking we have something to lose. There is no reason not to follow your heart.\u201d In the face of death, our problems are a joke. Family problems, financial problems all those problems its never life or death. It gives you a great perspective and I find big comfort in that.\n\n**Leaving a positive mark in this world**\n\nJonny lost brothers in war. He regrets not being able to save their lives as a medic. The reason why he became a doctor and an astronaut is because he wants to have as much of a positive impact in this world and that\u2019s how he honors the brothers that he lost.\n\n**Focus on the task in front of you**\n\nWe all have big goals and we get overwhelmed when we think about all the things we are supposed to do. But being worried about the future doesn\u2019t solve any problem, it doesn\u2019t get you any closer to your goals. Instead of worrying ask yourself what are the tasks I can do now that will get me a step closer to my goals and once you identify the task, focus on that task and take action.\n\n**Less you talk more people listen**\n\nOne thing I noticed with SEALS is that they all talk with no-nonsense. They take their time to answer questions accurately and they mean what they say. This allows them to be effective leaders when the time comes because people know they tell you the truth with no bullshit.\n\nThis doesn't do any justice to the podcast itself, Jonny Kim is one of the most modest and inspiring individual I have ever listened to.

problem I am planning to visit a psychologist with. In short:\n\n* 38yo kissless virgin male\n* I am objectively way below average in terms of look\n* 0 match on Tinder type of guy\n* I am unfortunately only attracted to extremely beautiful girls :(\n* I have a small and thin penis although this has zero relevance at the moment for obvious reasons\n* It happened in the past that a few women from my league were attracted to me but I did not find them attractive\n\nI do agree what I said above is very unsympathetic but unfortutanetly this is how it is. In the past 10 years I made a few female friends here and there and they suggested me to visit a psychologist.

So, once I achieve being an international brand, I will relate to all levels of aspects of my business well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It may not seem like a big deal but it is such a daring move for my personality!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmbm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "vuc0m2", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/selfimprovement/comments/vuc0m2/my_career_backward_move_is_selfimprovement_at_the/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/vuc0m2/my_career_backward_move_is_selfimprovement_at_the/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1352066, "created_utc": 1657290373.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfimprovement", "selftext": "guys. nofap will change your life. always keep that in your mind. if you can control your lust, you can control anything as a human. whenever you feel urges your just high in energy. that energy is valuable please do not waste it unnecessarily.", "author_fullname": "t2_dxm8rs1f", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "please stay on no fap", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/selfimprovement", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_vj0mk3", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.44, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1656000989.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.selfimprovement", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;guys. nofap will change your life. always keep that in your mind. if you can control your lust, you can control anything as a human. whenever you feel urges your just high in energy. that energy is valuable please do not waste it unnecessarily.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmbm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "vj0mk3", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheAppleMasterIsHere", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 6, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfimprovement/comments/vj0mk3/please_stay_on_no_fap/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/vj0mk3/please_stay_on_no_fap/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1352066, "created_utc": 1656000989.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfimprovement", "selftext": "I am single 21(male) still can't find a girlfriend nd everytime I propose a girl they just rejected me .
