I have seen this year, if not the best film in the past 5 years. It is just spectacular. So if you have not seen it, go watch it now. It was so good that I can't wait to rewatch it this weekend. In the meantime, I am biding my time by watching tons of cast interviews online.\n\nAs I watch interviews over and over, I can't help but notice just how charismatic Tom Cruise is. The man is obviously a superstar but you can tell he just radiates confidence and charisma wherever he goes. And what is his secret?\n\n**The \"mirroring\" technique.**\n\n*This technique is all about engaging with people in a way that ultimately \"mirrors\" what you yourself want to see.*\n\nGo in front of a mirror. You have done this routine thousands of times. What do you see? Are you happy with what you see? The mirror reflects back what you see. What you see is what you get. If you smile, you see a smile. If you frown, you will see a frown.\n\n**Likewise, in many human interactions, what you yourself SHOW is often \"mirrored\" back by the other person.** \n\nI want you to think, how often has someone approached you with a smile and a warm handshake and you have countered with disgust and anger? Probably never right? Unless you hated that person from the start. No, you probably appreciated it and almost took to liking the person already because of the warmth they show at first. As a result, you \"mirror\" this person by radiating warmth by returning a smile as well.\n\nNow, think of the polar opposite. Recall the last time someone approached you without a smile, with hunched shoulders, and you could barely hear their voice. How did you react to them? Probably a little guarded and not as enthusiastic to see them. In effect, you yourself have \"mirrored\" the same energy they themselves have given off.\n\nIn all of these interviews I have watched, Tom Cruise always greets every cast member and every interviewer with a radiant smile and enthusiastic approach. In return, the other members all \"mirror\" back that same energy so much so that you feel as if it's two buddies catching up.\n\n**People \"mirror\" the energy you are willing to radiate. You choose to be warm and kind and people most likely will do the same. If you act guarded and unapproachable, do not expect people to approach you any differently.**\n\nCharisma is an art that can be mastered. All it entails is being able to make the person as comfortable as possible in your presence and \"mirroring\" is the fastest way to do this.\n\nSo the next time you are meeting someone new? Think about the positive energy that you want \"mirrored\" back at you and then proceed to walk in and flash a smile at them. 99% of the time, they will radiate that same energy back to you.", "author_fullname": "t2_bwymb67e", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "To be charismatic, imitate Tom Cruise and implement the \"mirroring\" technique", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/selfimprovement", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_v6ojop", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 37, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 37, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1654583809.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.selfimprovement", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just came out of &lt;em&gt;Top Gun: Maverick&lt;/em&gt; and it is easily the best film I have seen this year, if not the best film in the past 5 years.

The man is obviously a superstar but you can tell he just radiates confidence and charisma wherever he goes. And what is his secret?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &amp;quot;mirroring&amp;quot; technique.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This technique is all about engaging with people in a way that ultimately &amp;quot;mirrors&amp;quot; what you yourself want to see.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go in front of a mirror. You have done this routine thousands of times. What do you see? Are you happy with what you see? The mirror reflects back what you see. What you see is what you get. If you smile, you see a smile. If you frown, you will see a frown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Likewise, in many human interactions, what you yourself SHOW is often &amp;quot;mirrored&amp;quot; back by the other person.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want you to think, how often has someone approached you with a smile and a warm handshake and you have countered with disgust and anger? Probably never right? Unless you hated that person from the start. No, you probably appreciated it and almost took to liking the person already because of the warmth they show at first. As a result, you &amp;quot;mirror&amp;quot; this person by radiating warmth by returning a smile as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, think of the polar opposite. Recall the last time someone approached you without a smile, with hunched shoulders, and you could barely hear their voice. How did you react to them? Probably a little guarded and not as enthusiastic to see them. In effect, you yourself have &amp;quot;mirrored&amp;quot; the same energy they themselves have given off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In all of these interviews I have watched, Tom Cruise always greets every cast member and every interviewer with a radiant smile and enthusiastic approach. In return, the other members all &amp;quot;mirror&amp;quot; back that same energy so much so that you feel as if it&amp;#39;s two buddies catching up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People &amp;quot;mirror&amp;quot; the energy you are willing to radiate. You choose to be warm and kind and people most likely will do the same. If you act guarded and unapproachable, do not expect people to approach you any differently.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Charisma is an art that can be mastered. All it entails is being able to make the person as comfortable as possible in your presence and &amp;quot;mirroring&amp;quot; is the fastest way to do this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the next time you are meeting someone new? Think about the positive energy that you want &amp;quot;mirrored&amp;quot; back at you and then proceed to walk in and flash a smile at them. 99% of the time, they will radiate that same energy back to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false,

film. There is a villain, and hero. \n\nThis is what makes the film interesting. But have you noticed. Minus \u201cthe joker\u201d the villain NEVER \nsuffers from depression, \nor gets tired or sleeps in, \nor arrives late, \ndecides to take a day off. \nOr has a deep introspective mental breakdown about some crap that happened years ago. \n\nHe just, relentlessly strives towards his goal. (Usually something huge, like world domination, killing James Bond, destroying humanity, genocide or some other epic task.)\n\nYou see, the villain. Cannot afford to \u201ctake a day of\u201d and has no time to \u201cfeel depress\u201d hell, he may be deeply sad inside and feel massive anxiety when he goes outside but none of that matters to him. \n\nThe TASK is soooo important ALL HE CAN DO is chase after this goal. \n\nThe villain \u201clet\u2019s use BANE\u201d from Batman, Excellently played by Tom Hardy. In Banes entire lifetime their was likely a time when a woman broke his heart, he also likely woke up numerous days with severe aches and  injuries from fighting and missions. \n\nHe never had the time to worry about these things. He had a city to free and destroy, he had a goal. \n\nNow In your own film, you are the hero. And your VILLAIN\u2026. IS YOU. \n\nYou see I bet often you see a guy like Ronaldo, or Dan Bilzerian, or Elon Musk, or Lebron James etc and think damn, life is so good for him, and compare yourself.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t fair on yourself as you have had TOTALLY different up bringings and talents and they Likley had massive help behind the scenes that you never received.\n\nYOUR VILLAIN IN YOUR FILM. \u2026. IS YOU. \n\nTHIS IS A VERSION OF YOU, THE EVIL RELENTLESS BANE TYPE CHARACTER BUT YOU.\n\nHE HAD ALL THE SAME TALENTS AND SAME UPBRINGING, HE HAD THE SAME LIFE AS YOU, so it\u2019s a fair comparison. \n\nTHE ONLY THING DIFFERENT ABOUT HIM IS \u2026\n\nNO MATTER HOW THIS GUY \u201cfeels\u201d HE SIMPLY DOES WHAT HES SUPPOSED TO DO.\n\n1. He goes to the gym every day, no matter what, no matter how he feels or if his leg hurts or he thinks people will laugh at him, or if he is weak. He goes. \n\n2. He knows he needs money to enjoy life so when he is not in the gym he is working, looking for a better job or gaining qualifications to get a better job. He does not watch Tv, he does not play video games, he is trying to make money. He does my type \u201chOw TO gEt rICh \u201c on YouTube he just works hard earns money and saves it. \n\n3. Yes all the same chicks that broke your heart broke his heart aswell he is you after all but , he doesn\u2019t dwell on it, EVERYDAY no matter what he walks up to 5 women. \n\nAnd simply says \u201cHi, I just noticed you (walking here/in the vegetable isle, coming down the platform, on the bus) and I think you are beautiful. *don\u2019t smile or laugh or do some soft shit just say this like a man. It\u2019s true isn\u2019t it.\n\n\u201cMy name is *tell her ur stupid name* shake her hand. And keep talking. Ask her where she is from, ask her real questions that u are actually curious about ? Ask her for her INSTAGRAM. Every beautiful woman has one, and has tons of followers SHE WILL GIVE YOU THIS. Wish her good bye and boom. 100 times a month. Women sorted.\n\n4. He never gets tired or feels down, he just continues his path. Unfortunately being a man, means nobody gives a crap about ur mental health and honestly neither should you, all you should care about is making money and getting laid. The rest is all cope lol. There is a reason why all the depressed guys are from the Us or the Uk or Europe the men in Syria with bombs dropping on their head or the 14 year old in Thailand working in a Nike factory 16 hrs a day has no time to think about his gender or how he feels or world peace or go to silly protests he has a job to feed his mother and brothers he does it. whats ur excuse \n\n5. He never spends money on bullshit, do you think BANE would waste money on a sugary junk food meal on route to hijacking a plane ? No the plane is the priority , your plane should be success.\n\n6. You must compete with this version of yourself everyday, the girl you were shy to talk to, he spoke to her, the last rep in the gym he did it , the job interview he was on time and acted confident and got the job.\n\n7. Remember this guy you created is you, he was born with the exact same body as you but he\u2019s ripped because he has been hurting the gym daily everyday he is good with women cos he spoke to 5 a day every 5 days , he has money because all he Eve thought about and acted on was improving his financial situation. All those times you were sulking and crying or scrolling on TikTok or Instagram he was applying for better jobs or getting qualifications or hitting on women in real life. \n\n8. Bonus Tip : stop dicking around with fancy dumb bodybuilding splits and silly diets you never stick to five x five StrongLifts 3 days a week 3 compounds increase weight each week , eat whatever the hell you like juts eat alot get big man. Twice a day you should feel FULL. In a year you will be bigger and stronger and more confident simple \n\nBECOME YOUR OWN VILLAIN", "author_fullname": "t2_n69gpsaw", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "STEP BY STEP GUIDE TO BECOMING A TOP TIER MAN, hint You already know exactly why you\u2019re a loser.

IS YOU. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THIS IS A VERSION OF YOU, THE EVIL RELENTLESS BANE TYPE CHARACTER BUT YOU.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;HE HAD ALL THE SAME TALENTS AND SAME UPBRINGING, HE HAD THE SAME LIFE AS YOU, so it\u2019s a fair comparison. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THE ONLY THING DIFFERENT ABOUT HIM IS \u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NO MATTER HOW THIS GUY \u201cfeels\u201d HE SIMPLY DOES WHAT HES SUPPOSED TO DO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He goes to the gym every day, no matter what, no matter how he feels or if his leg hurts or he thinks people will laugh at him, or if he is weak. He goes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He knows he needs money to enjoy life so when he is not in the gym he is working, looking for a better job or gaining qualifications to get a better job. He does not watch Tv, he does not play video games, he is trying to make money. He does my type \u201chOw TO gEt rICh \u201c on YouTube he just works hard earns money and saves it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes all the same chicks that broke your heart broke his heart aswell he is you after all but , he doesn\u2019t dwell on it, EVERYDAY no matter what he walks up to 5 women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And simply says \u201cHi, I just noticed you (walking here/in the vegetable isle, coming down the platform, on the bus) and I think you are beautiful. *don\u2019t smile or laugh or do some soft shit just say this like a man. It\u2019s true isn\u2019t it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMy name is &lt;em&gt;tell her ur stupid name&lt;/em&gt; shake her hand. And keep talking. Ask her where she is from, ask her real questions that u are actually curious about ? Ask her for her INSTAGRAM. Every beautiful woman has one, and has tons of followers SHE WILL GIVE YOU THIS. Wish her good bye and boom. 100 times a month. Women sorted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He never gets tired or feels down, he just continues his path. Unfortunately being a man, means nobody gives a crap about ur mental health and honestly neither should you, all you should care about is making money and getting laid. The rest is all cope lol. There is a reason why all the depressed guys are from the Us or the Uk or Europe the men in Syria with bombs dropping on their head or the 14 year old in Thailand working in a Nike factory 16 hrs a day has no time to think about his gender or how he feels or world peace or go to silly protests he has a job to feed his mother and brothers he does it. whats ur excuse &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He never spends money on bullshit, do you think BANE would waste money on a sugary junk food meal on route to hijacking a plane ? No the plane is the priority , your plane should be success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You must compete with this version of yourself everyday, the girl you were shy to talk to, he spoke to her, the last rep in the gym he did it , the job interview he was on time and acted confident and got the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember this guy you created is you, he was born with the exact same body as you but he\u2019s ripped because he has been hurting the gym daily everyday he is good with women cos he spoke to 5 a day every 5 days , he has money because all he Eve thought about and acted on was improving his financial situation. All those times you were sulking and crying or scrolling on TikTok or Instagram he was applying for better jobs or getting qualifications or hitting on women in real life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonus Tip : stop dicking around with fancy dumb bodybuilding splits and silly diets you never stick to five x five StrongLifts 3 days a week 3 compounds increase weight each week , eat whatever the hell you like juts eat alot get big man. Twice a day you should feel FULL. In a year you will be bigger and stronger and more confident simple &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BECOME YOUR OWN VILLAIN&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "8723247e-1e96-11ed-94d7-0eabd5e537a3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmbm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#ffb000", "id": "zq73nj", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FrozenShadowsTV", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 7, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfimprovement/comments/zq73nj/step_by_step_guide_to_becoming_a_top_tier_man/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/zq73nj/step_by_step_guide_to_becoming_a_top_tier_man/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1352066, "created_utc": 1671492281.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "selfimprovement", "selftext": "first of all wtf am I doing here?

Repeatedly. With such an invigorating and intellectually stimulating plot, the next remake is just a matter of time. My bets are on 2026. Anyway, imagine you switched bodies with someone you look up to, an idol of yours, someone that has achieved everything you dream of achieving yourself one day. They have it all. The money, the brain, the body, the fame. And out of nothing, within the blink of an eye, you inhabit their body, living their life. You have everything you ever wanted, just like that. It's weird at first, but you certainly don't mind. Fast forward a few years. Life is not exactly how you would have hoped. A lot of things went downhill, alarmingly fast. The money? At this point, you've lost pretty much everything. And with it, all of that status, fame, and the cognitive abilities of your shiny new brain. But hey, at least you gained one thing: a whole lot of body fat. Generally quite depressed, you catch yourself daydreaming a lot lately. If only you could be like that person they keep mentioning in the news. Apparently, they managed to build an empire out of nothing within just a few years, unbelievable! And they look somewhat familiar, almost like the old version of yourself, just healthier, more charismatic, and better in every way. Oh, how you envy them...\n\nI bet everyone has heard the stories of lottery winners that have lost everything within just a couple of years. A rich person is more than just the number on their bank account. It's the sum of personality traits, skills, habits, and the network they create around themselves. The same thing is true for pretty much everything else in life that's worth achieving. A healthy, fit person wasn't just lucky. They spend a lot of time and effort on maintaining their body, using habits they have built over many years.\n\nSo instead of waiting for a Freaky Friday scenario to miraculously make all your dreams come true, how about you adopt the habits of this future version of yourself, the version that has everything figured out?\n\n# Step 1: What do you want?\n\nSit down, with a pen and piece of paper (preferably multiple, especially if you're ambitious, and everyone likes to think of themselves as ambitious, right?). How do you want your life to look like roughly 5 years from now? Which job do you have? Where do you live? Do you own a house? How about your relationship? Are you married by then? How's your lifestyle? Any new skills you picked up? Any bad habits you finally got rid of? Dream up the perfect life for yourself, as vivid and detailed as possible. Try to cover all aspects. Use this list for inspiration:\n\n* Health/Body\n* Mental/Emotional\n* Partner/Love\n* Family\n* Friends\n* Mission\n* Experiences\n* Finances\n* Learning\n\n# Step 2: How will you be like?\n\nTo circumvent any limiting beliefs you might have, in the next step, you will stop associating yourself with this ideal future version you have constructed. From now on, this is some random person that just happens to perfectly align with your own aspirations. What are they like? What is special about their personality? Can you sketch out a typical day for this person? What do they do throughout this day? Which habits do they have? Also: which habits are absent? A successful real estate investor might do regular trips throughout their preferred neighborhoods to stay up to date on how certain parts of it are developing and serendipitously stumble across potential deals. A passionate teacher might spend Saturday afternoons volunteering for an organization that keeps local kids off the streets, not only to support them, but also to widen their perspective on what education actually is, and how important it is for the next generation.\n\n# Step 3: Research habits of real-world examples\n\nTo help round out this person you are constructing in your mind, think of some real-world examples of people that are doing what you want to do in the next few years, or at least parts of it. Depending on how famous these types of people would be, you can either google their habits directly, go through some interviews, ask around on Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, or maybe you even know some already and can just invite them for a coffee?\n\n# Step 4: Assess your habits, and adopt new ones\n\nAt this point, you should have a list of habits, traits, and skills that are central to this person. Notice how we didn't focus on how they got to where they are, but just on what they do repeatedly. In most cases, simply adopting these habits will inevitably lead you down the correct path. Assess how well your current habits align. Which ones would be easiest to adapt and adopt, which ones would have the greatest impact? But don't overdo it, take baby steps and go for one habit at a time. If you're having problems when it comes to new habits and sticking to them long-term, I highly recommend \"Atomic Habits\" by James Clear. He summarized the most effective ways to integrate new habits into your daily routine.\n\nAll this talk of habits and Freaky Friday got me thinking: What if instead of bodies, Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis switched their daily routines and habits...?

If you put a condition or exception to your own guiding principle, then it isn't a principle, it's just mental masturbation at best.\n\nThe most inner growth you could possibly experience comes from sticking to this principle when it feels difficult.

Silence. I asked again. Silence. I asked 5 more times, feeling like I had to convince *myself* to be honest with me, and I suddenly found myself rattling off maybe 10 things I despised about myself, bawling like a baby the entire time. I accepted each \"flaw\" as it arose, and found a positive angle for it. For example, \"I accept that I *am* bald at 24, and I *am* goofier than most would expect, especially given my appearance.

I&amp;#39;ll probably just make some friends instead until I know I&amp;#39;m healed from my 8 year sex habit and really looking for a deep connection.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "298cd47c-1e96-11ed-bd72-fe7bc3f1a69c", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmbm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#94e044", "id": "xtxwto", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ok-Researcher4598", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/selfimprovement/comments/xtxwto/i_want_to_heal_from_masturbation_when_going_on/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/xtxwto/i_want_to_heal_from_masturbation_when_going_on/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1352066, "created_utc": 1664740018.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}
