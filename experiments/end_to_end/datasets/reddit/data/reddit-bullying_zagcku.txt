He assured me I would be paid and that he was only trying to \u201chelp\u201d me, and knew what was \u201cbest for\u201d me. Less than a week later I do end up getting fired, after I worked 29.48 hours on the clock the previous week. To date I have received a total of $0 from the company. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) \u201cIf you do not delete your email account within 1 minute we are going to file a defamation lawsuit against you.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is another case where they know I sent an email alleging abuse and mistreatment and corporate bullying and harassment, for which I was retaliated against, isolated, received reduced pay, and loss privileges in terms of having the freedom and flexibility I desired. When the sales manager called to inform me of this it was 6 o\u2019clock at night, I was no longer employed by the company, and I calmly noted that \u201cI was off the clock and you can\u2019t control me.\u201d My girlfriend was also present for this call, which to me, indicated they needed to \u201cget rid of the evidence.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was forced to accept a new pay plan and job duties, be isolated from the team, and has strict rules about punching a clock. I was also promised production incentives and bonuses I never received, and when I questioned this my needs were ignored. They don\u2019t want me to tell the truth and expose their business. If I was them I would think twice before threatening to sue me after you emotionally damaged me and caused significant problems to frustrate me to the point where I had no other choice but to leave or to get fired\u2014 so they could avoid not paying me for work I performed, produced, and generated. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Google \u201cMalignant Narcissism\u201d or \u201cPsychopath\u201dto learn more about these toxic \u201cpersonality disorders.\u201d Also \u201cWorkplace Bullying,\u201d \u201cGaslighting,\u201d and \u201cEmotional Abuse\u201d OR stay tuned for more education, more content, and more details... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/fSeZOQ6mwsQ\"&gt;https://youtu.be/fSeZOQ6mwsQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/dRjm7LZ2CEY\"&gt;https://youtu.be/dRjm7LZ2CEY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/-bhrqQ5zNmc\"&gt;https://youtu.be/-bhrqQ5zNmc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/K_CCA7KAou4\"&gt;https://youtu.be/K_CCA7KAou4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/9DZmrV9WGLI\"&gt;https://youtu.be/9DZmrV9WGLI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/tZ_bxRF1A6nZTKisxRqbkz10Exathl17ZCwPdEv8HRA.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=6177d4c6fdca87b1de0c3001baf335a9d62d3835", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/tZ_bxRF1A6nZTKisxRqbkz10Exathl17ZCwPdEv8HRA.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06220c51437e8e84f96e9d680c5a9d20102a65ef", "width": 108, "height": 81}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/tZ_bxRF1A6nZTKisxRqbkz10Exathl17ZCwPdEv8HRA.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb3d48f3e2aa5f65c8a2156a59829a1035b02272", "width": 216, "height": 162}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/tZ_bxRF1A6nZTKisxRqbkz10Exathl17ZCwPdEv8HRA.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a65527cbe5b7195a28f750f187e5575f6b04423d", "width": 320, "height": 240}], "variants": {}, "id": "C7N7r_0bsTJGVmI_zNDGlXeOAs9aNm_WlHP4rOn0EMk"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sw9l", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "yuj4ro", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheNickofTime2022", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 3, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": null, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/bullying/comments/yuj4ro/5_emotionally_abusive_things_the_managers_said_to/", "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/yuj4ro/5_emotionally_abusive_things_the_managers_said_to/", "subreddit_subscribers": 7766, "created_utc": 1668383987.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "bullying", "selftext": "So the first show idea was a show apart four royal siblings who each have powers to control the seasons \n\nThe second was a show about a raven who wants to change the troupe of ravens only being sidekicks to villains in fictional story\u2019s and wants to help heroes \n\nThen the third was a recreation of the prince and the pauper \n\nPeople just hate these ideas and one person told me to rip the season idea apart when I showed them the paper \n\nI just don\u2019t know why\n\nAre my ideas unnerving?

Throughout the entire school year, there was a boy that would bully me, especially during homeroom. He would call me names, throw his food and items at me, and would even go out of his way to memorize my class schedule just so he knows what times to harass me. Nobody did anything about it, even when I tried to ask for help. But it was during my science class when I finally snapped. The teacher was out of the classroom when the same boy that bullied me was now bullying an Arabic girl that was sitting at the front of the class. He was calling her a terrorist while playing bomb sounds on his school laptop with full volume. The girl kept telling him to leave her alone, but of course, he didn't listen. I was hesitant to stand up to him for her because a part of me was telling me \"Why should you stand up for her? Nobody stood up for you when he was bullying you.\" But then I realized that that was why. Just because nobody stood up for me, doesn't mean I shouldn't help others when they need it. So I finally got up from my desk and approached him, telling him to leave her alone. He immediately began teasing me again, but I didn't care. I took the girl away from him and let her sit with me. Once the bell rang for the class to be over, we all got up to leave, but the bully wasn't backing down yet. He got up first and ran to the now open door, blocking it and forcing the whole class to stay inside the room. He then yelled at me, saying he'll only let us leave the classroom if I admit that the girl was a terrorist. I refused and he continued to yell at me, asking how could I defend a terrorist. This finally made me snap and caused me to do something I wouldn't normally do. I rushed at him and shoved him away from the door, causing him to fall harshly onto the floor in the middle of the hallway, making other kids who were in the hall to stop and see what was going on. I quickly took the girls hand and ran out of the classroom. Once we got away from the scene, I began talking to the girl, asking her if she was okay. She said yes and after more talking, we found out we had the same math class, so we began walking there together. Ever since that day, she became my friend.

This finally made me snap and caused me to do something I wouldn&amp;#39;t normally do. I rushed at him and shoved him away from the door, causing him to fall harshly onto the floor in the middle of the hallway, making other kids who were in the hall to stop and see what was going on. I quickly took the girls hand and ran out of the classroom. Once we got away from the scene, I began talking to the girl, asking her if she was okay. She said yes and after more talking, we found out we had the same math class, so we began walking there together. Ever since that day, she became my friend. I&amp;#39;m now in college and we still talk to this day. What I want people to take from my story is that it&amp;#39;s always good to stand up for others, you could be saving someone from a much worse situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sw9l", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "yrmm8o", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sabbiboss234", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": null, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/bullying/comments/yrmm8o/racist_bully_long_story/", "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/yrmm8o/racist_bully_long_story/", "subreddit_subscribers": 7766, "created_utc": 1668102785.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "bullying", "selftext": "For a year now I've been harassed both physically and not by the same group of girls.\nThere's a lot of them in the school and I'm beginning to think I'm in the wrong. \nThey seem to have taken a dislike to me since I joined in year 7 but began in year 8.\nThe first instance was when this boy came up to me and started making fun of me and calling me Ching-Chong and telling me He was getting me deported. \nI've been in two fights, 2 physical harassments, 4 outside of school incidents etc.\nI've given in statements and reported time and time again and the worst punishment they got was isolation for a day.\nI've tried to ignore it, I've tried to retaliate, no matter what I do they don't stop and nobody does anything about it.\nMy parents are suggesting calling the police.

I'm sorry.  We parents help pay your salary so you can do a job you chose to do...that involves putting a bunch of kids together, drama is going to happen.  Why would you just sit there and allow it to fester?  These children are our future caregivers, officers, teachers, mothers, fathers, or our future problems!!! You could spend even ONE day a month role-playing social dilemmas, or reinforcing teaching in healthy relationships, healthy communication styles, leadership...can we not sacrifice one day of common core math and art projects to have our kids demonstrate how they are learning to effectively deal with \"drama\".  What can it hurt?? More and more kids are checking into ERs everywhere for suicide and they are coming from all different walks of life and socioeconomic status'.  Sure, there are children who are more vulnerable but I am still checking in middle and upper class white kids who's parents don't find out till it's too late that they are completely wrecked inside.  I don't even want to hear it's cause their weak.  It's not.  It's because they aren't forming adequate and meaningful relationships and social media is huge to blame.  It is directly linked to suicide and depression.  Either the parent is addicted to the electronic and emotionally neglecting the child, the child is addicted or BOTH!  Its because they are not learning effective coping.  They aren't practicing enough anymore!!!

So now my child has had a hard time focusing on the unnecessary ways to add simple math problems because the mean girl in her class is getting away with being an a hole right under the teachers nose because \"I'm over it\"  I'm so glad we got what's left of you teacher, now please move on for the rest!! \n\n\n\nAnyway...How does this teacher not know yet in this tiny small town school that her daughter is cruel and how can another one just decide its not important enough to address every now and then?

In elementary school the kids were so cruel to me that I would force myself to throw up in the bathroom everyday so I could look and feel sick enough to leave school. Now I\u2019m in college and still struggle with stomach pains. After I described the stomach issues a doctor had asked me if I was bullied I guess it\u2019s more common than I thought. But middle school it still continued. It was so brutal that I began doing terrible things to cope.  I truly wanted to just end my life. In highschool I still couldn\u2019t catch a break. But I never fought back to any of these people or truly wronged them in any way. I just feel like something has to be wrong with me. If I\u2019ve been bullied for this long then there has to be something or some valid reasoning for these people doing this. But I still carry all of it with me today and it\u2019s caused a lot of lasting mental health issues within me.

Anyways.\n\nEverything started when I was playing basketball with two friends and the three kids (12 - 13yo) wanted to play, so we let them play.  They started to play and after we decided to not let them play anymore, because was annoying to have these kids there. So they started to catch our ball and throw it away in different places... We were so fucking annoyed and angry. That day they started to do the same with different groups of students (from the U). When the school has ended it, they apologized to everyone except us.  \n\n\nNowadays they are keeping bothering me... ONLY ME. idk why. When i walk around in the campus, they sometimes find me and started saying something like: \"hey wig, hey toupee ahhahah\" and they start laughing. (I have a long hair, probably almost reach my shoulders). I know that its stupid, but that  pisses me off. You don't have idea.

This was after I asked my grandma (she\u2019s my legal guardian since I\u2019m an orphan) to tell the school I\u2019m being bullied. This morning there was a psych patient on the loose and was trying to hide in our school (my school is 2 minutes away by walk from a psychiatric facility) so our school went into lockdown. There\u2019s this area in the school that has benches, so when I arrived I ran to it and placed my backpack there. (I forgot to mention that as I was entering the school, my backpack opened and my pencil case fell) My pencil case was on top. I left my backpack unattended and went to get breakfast. The bell rang and I picked my stuff up and went to my classroom. As I set my stuff down, I notice something written on my pencil case. Upon closer inspection there it was. \u201cOP\u2019s ass smells like shit\u201d. Before I continue, this is a new school and I have scalp psoriasis and my classmates are bullying me for it and for me being an orphan. They\u2019ve excluded me, given me death threats and even spiked my drinks. Anyways I told my grandma and sent her a message. She went to the school and talked. Turns out all of my teachers told the counselor that something was happening here at the school involving me. Anyways I was called in, and I sobbed. I\u2019ve never felt more like shit, and I\u2019ve been bullied my whole life, it has even costed me expulsion because of a rumor. So I completely started to tell the counselors EVERYTHING. I didn\u2019t give names at first, but as I kept saying, they knew who was taunting and bullying me. Anyways yea, on Monday I will need to sign a paper because of it, and since there\u2019s been situations with those students before, they might get suspended or expelled.

This was after I asked my grandma (she\u2019s my legal guardian since I\u2019m an orphan) to tell the school I\u2019m being bullied. This morning there was a psych patient on the loose and was trying to hide in our school (my school is 2 minutes away by walk from a psychiatric facility) so our school went into lockdown. There\u2019s this area in the school that has benches, so when I arrived I ran to it and placed my backpack there. (I forgot to mention that as I was entering the school, my backpack opened and my pencil case fell) My pencil case was on top. I left my backpack unattended and went to get breakfast. The bell rang and I picked my stuff up and went to my classroom. As I set my stuff down, I notice something written on my pencil case. Upon closer inspection there it was. \u201cOP\u2019s ass smells like shit\u201d. Before I continue, this is a new school and I have scalp psoriasis and my classmates are bullying me for it and for me being an orphan. They\u2019ve excluded me, given me death threats and even spiked my drinks. Anyways I told my grandma and sent her a message. She went to the school and talked. Turns out all of my teachers told the counselor that something was happening here at the school involving me. Anyways I was called in, and I sobbed. I\u2019ve never felt more like shit, and I\u2019ve been bullied my whole life, it has even costed me expulsion because of a rumor. So I completely started to tell the counselors EVERYTHING. I didn\u2019t give names at first, but as I kept saying, they knew who was taunting and bullying me. Anyways yea, on Monday I will need to sign a paper because of it, and since there\u2019s been situations with those students before, they might get suspended or expelled.

She also mentioned this is the first time she\u2019s had my son in her office this year. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He comes home complaining on a daily basis of the same 2 boys bullying him at recess, one of which was involved in this leaf fight. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a ton of concerns now hearing this.
